<!-- Submarine names & descriptions -->
<submarine.name.humpback>Humpback</submarine.name.humpback>
<submarine.description.humpback>A former military vessel, WH4-L3 "Humpback" has been outfitted to withstand most of the dangers in deep Europa. Her relatively high velocity is offset by low maneuverability. As she's still boasting an older model reactor, power needs to be supplemented by a backup battery array or the crew will find themselves unable to run all of the new equipment.</submarine.description.humpback>
<submarine.name.bunyip>Bunyip</submarine.name.bunyip>
<submarine.description.bunyip>Latest in the line of personnel transports, Bunyip is capable of ferrying crew between spaceships and installations. Its operating radius is considerably lower than its more advanced cousins and no weapons on board makes it vulnerable to attacks.</submarine.description.bunyip>
<submarine.name.muikku>Muikku</submarine.name.muikku>
<submarine.description.muikku>The workhorse of the colonies, these little shuttles have good speed and dive/ascent characteristics, but they are fragile and their low-capacity batteries limit their range somewhat.</submarine.description.muikku>
<submarine.name.orca>Orca</submarine.name.orca>
<submarine.description.orca>With a relatively high top speed and fantastic ascent and descent characteristics due to her 3 large ballast tanks, Orca class subs are agile vessels, let down only by their small compliment of weapons, unreliable engine and reactors with a greater than average hunger for fuel.</submarine.description.orca>
<submarine.name.remora>Remora</submarine.name.remora>
<submarine.description.remora>A range of customization options are available for Remora. In this model, some of the main hull space has been replaced by a detachable ballast and a remote-controlled drone. A large crew is needed to operate this spaceship.</submarine.description.remora>
<submarine.name.typhon>Typhon</submarine.name.typhon>
<submarine.description.typhon>Typhon class subs are known for their brutish appearance, reasonable array of light and heavy firepower, and their general dependability. Any captain should be aware of their poor rate of descent and unimpressive top speed.</submarine.description.typhon>
<submarine.name.dugong>Dugong</submarine.name.dugong>
<submarine.name.dugong_tutorial>Dugong</submarine.name.dugong_tutorial>
<submarine.description.dugong>Compared to larger vessels, the Dugong series is overshadowed in all aspects except one: Their reliability for their price is world class. They're lacking in firepower and speed, so smart maneuvering is key.</submarine.description.dugong>
<submarine.name.selkie>Selkie</submarine.name.selkie>
<submarine.description.selkie>The workhorse of the colonies, these little shuttles have good speed and dive/ascent characteristics, but they are fragile and their low-capacity batteries limit their range somewhat.</submarine.description.selkie>
<submarine.name.venture>Venture</submarine.name.venture>
<submarine.description.venture>Originally intended as research vessels, Venture shuttles have been co-opted as a more robust alternative for travel between outposts and spaceships.</submarine.description.venture>
<submarine.name.berilia>Berilia</submarine.name.berilia>

<submarine.name.kastrull>Kastrull</submarine.name.kastrull>
<submarine.description.kastrull>The Kastrull is a dependable attack sub class bringing plenty of firepower to any fight, and although it's not very nimble, it does sport a drone gunship as standard. Keep in mind that with its experimental open ballast tanks, low tolerance to flooding and numerous crew stations, a large, experienced crew will get the most out of this sub.</submarine.description.kastrull>
<submarine.name.hemulen>Hemulen</submarine.name.hemulen>
<submarine.description.hemulen>For when you need extra room to stretch your legs or want some space between you and the poor, choose Hemulen shuttles.</submarine.description.hemulen>
<submarine.name.typhon2>Typhon 2</submarine.name.typhon2>
<submarine.description.typhon2>Typhon 2 is an overhauled version of the venerable Typhon class of sub. Serving as a heavy gunship, the Typhon 2 class subs remain slow and ugly, but with the benefit of better survivability for their crews.</submarine.description.typhon2>
<submarine.name.azimuth>Azimuth</submarine.name.azimuth>
<submarine.description.azimuth>Superior speed, sleek design and quality-of-life systems make this spaceship a favorite among wealthy Coalition captains who manage to make it to retirement.</submarine.description.azimuth>
<submarine.name.r-29>R-29 "Big Rig"</submarine.name.r-29>
<submarine.description.r-29>R-29 is a heavyweight transport ship. While not terribly well armed against Europa's underwater denizens, it has been retrofitted with two powerful electric discharge coils. Original design by rav2n.</submarine.description.r-29>
<submarine.name.barsuk>Barsuk</submarine.name.barsuk>
<submarine.description.barsuk>Barsuk is a favorite among beginner captains. Using materials out of recycled hulls of destroyed spaceships (many of which were Barsuks anyway) keeps the price of the line down. Over the years, a subculture of Barsuk-enthusiasts has formed around customizing and tuning their vessels.</submarine.description.barsuk>
<submarine.name.winterhalter>Winterhalter</submarine.name.winterhalter>
<submarine.description.winterhalter>Originally manufactured by Archsteel Yards in New Iapetus, Winterhalter spaceships were only in production for a year until they were acquired by the Coalition for research purposes. Many surviving models come equipped with an onboard research laboratory, and they are heavily armed.</submarine.description.winterhalter>
<submarine.name.herja>Herja</submarine.name.herja>
<submarine.description.herja>With its varied weaponry, Herja spaceships are equipped for encounters against most expected and unexpected run-ins with the denizens of Europa. A reliable workhorse in the Coalition fleet. If a monster nest has been cleared nearby, chances are high that it was a Herja that did the deed.</submarine.description.herja>
<submarine.name.orca2>Orca 2</submarine.name.orca2>
<submarine.description.orca2>Successor for the classic Orca series, this spaceship boasts the same three-ballast setup which allows it to ascend and descend with only a moment's notice. Well armed and equipped for a scout vessel, Orca2 is capable of taking on all but the most dangerous denizens of Europa.</submarine.description.orca2>
<submarine.name.camel>Camel</submarine.name.camel>
<submarine.description.camel>Easily identified by its two humps, the CML (Cargo &amp; Medical Logistics) spaceship is best known as the Camel. The Camel has an extensive medic bay and ample cargo space, but it handles flooding poorly. The front ballast tank is a liability, and some less-liked crewmembers may have found an untimely death in an "accident" there. Trivia: The two humps are welded to the spaceship during missions, but they can still be detached relatively easily when needed to supply heavier equipment to stations.</submarine.description.camel>

<terminalwelcomemsg.kastrulldiary1>\nDay 1 of the expedition out of Meltwater. We're navigating through a newly discovered gap in the ice, trying to find a shorter route to Novaya Moskva.\n\nIt's not the safest of missions, but hopefully it'll be my last. Should be able to retire after this one.\n\nDay 3. Cap says the whole voyage shouldn't take more than six days. By my reckoning that should place us somewhere around halfway there.\n\nCourse there's always a chance this cave doesn't actually have an exit and we'll have to turn back.\n\nDay 4. Now if I were a superstitious man, I'd wager that saying the worst outcome in any given situation out loud makes it come true. Turns out this route is a dead end.\n\nCaptain is bummed out. I share his disappointment. It'll take a few days longer to get to an outpost now that we have to go back.\n\nDay 8. There was a hole in the ice here. It's gone now. Icebergs must've moved and closed it. We've started broadcasting our position in hopes that someone picks it up. They're joking now, asking me why I chose my last expedition to get lost at sea.\n\nDay 9. We're rationing food and water. Crew is getting ornery.\n\nDay 11? 12? No response. Food's running out. More concerned about water, myself. Don't feel like writing any more.\n\nDay 30-ish, who cares anymore? I'm surrounded by dead men. Pale husks of men slumped on the floor. Some of their eyes still move, but they're dead nonetheless.\n</terminalwelcomemsg.kastrulldiary1>

<terminalwelcomemsg.traitorletter>This message will be both my farewell and confession. I was tasked to smuggle this sonar beacon on board and turn it on when we were a safe distance away. It turns out it was set to a frequency that attracts monsters. I was promised a shuttle was picking me up when the task was done but they never showed.\n\nThis is the last time I accept a "research assignment" from a big-shoe. Or anyone, for that matter. May they honk in hell.</terminalwelcomemsg.traitorletter>

<!-- Job descriptions -->
<tutorial.mechanictitle>Mechanic - Glue, duct tape and your nerve are the only things keeping the crew alive.</tutorial.mechanictitle>
<tutorial.mechanicdescription>When the plan goes as planned and the gear works is as probable as the human race leaving this shithole. There are no breaks or rest for you, as everything that can break down, will break down. And if nothing’s broken, then it's maintenance, maintenance, maintenance. Getting to the next destination is all that matters, and you’re the one who delivers. There’s no thank-yous or respect, just snickering and contempt from your "fellow crewmembers"—but that’s okay. This is YOUR survival vessel, and if any of them make it too, well...whoop dee doo for them.</tutorial.mechanicdescription>
<tutorial.mechanicresponsibilities>Responsibilities\n-Maintenance of machinery\n-Repairing leaks</tutorial.mechanicresponsibilities>
<tutorial.engineertitle>Engineer - The one who harnesses the power of nature.</tutorial.engineertitle>
<tutorial.engineerdescription>Power and oxygen, it's like that. Without, the ship don’t move and the lungs won’t breathe. Beyond the fancy talk and costume play, you are the guy who really runs the ship, get it? Trust in the laws of physics and think clear. Also, keep your eye on that damn toy-tinkering wannabe engineer mechanic, and whatever you do, don’t bite into the psycho-babble of the medic. He’s so deep in his softie inner world he’s practically a woman. Captain and security are harmless, and way below your intelligence. Obviously.</tutorial.engineerdescription>
<tutorial.engineerresponsibilities>Responsibilities\n-Electrical item maintenance\n-Operating the reactor</tutorial.engineerresponsibilities>
<tutorial.securityofficertitle>Security Officer - The backbone of violence.</tutorial.securityofficertitle>
<tutorial.securityofficerdescription>It is said that pressure brings out the worst in people. Not everybody has your moral strength—hell, most of them are so crooked that it’s questionable if they even should be allowed to live. Channel the crew’s anger toward the creatures outside, but never fool yourself into trusting them. Keep the nukes ready, the handcuffs available, and every now and then put someone in the brig just so they know who’s in charge!</tutorial.securityofficerdescription>
<tutorial.securityofficerresponsibilities>Responsibilities\n-Keeping the order\n-Repelling intruders</tutorial.securityofficerresponsibilities>
<tutorial.medicaldoctortitle>Medical Doctor - Maintaining the key resource: the people</tutorial.medicaldoctortitle>
<tutorial.medicaldoctordescription>Guns and engines and reactors don't keep the ship running—people do. It’s up to you to keep the gunner alive to man the guns and captain alive to steer the ship. And remember, your job goes well beyond the physical. We live crammed into tight spaces, under ice, in the sea. When the lights go out and your "buddies" go to sleep, all kinds of dark shit crawls into their minds. Keep them alive and sane, or put them down like dogs. It’s up to you.</tutorial.medicaldoctordescription>
<tutorial.medicaldoctorresponsibilities>Responsibilities\n-First aid\n-Poisons and antidotes</tutorial.medicaldoctorresponsibilities>
<tutorial.captaintitle>Captain - Naval visionary, seafarer, a genius. Possibly.</tutorial.captaintitle>
<tutorial.captaindescription>Captain Ahab once said, "Hell is an idea first born on an undigested apple-dumpling." Do you know what that means? No. Does the crew think you are a mysterious genius? Hell yeah. This job is at least as much appearing to know what to do as actually knowing what to do. You are the map and the compass, the guy with the big picture. Navigate and make the tough calls. And remember, you’re just a few steps away from being the mayor of an outpost, and if a couple fellows need to die for that—so be it!</tutorial.captaindescription>

<tutorial.roles.message.2>“Whoa, such enthusiasm, dude! I love it! Are you familiar with the courses we offer?”</tutorial.roles.message.2>
<tutorial.roles.message.2_player1>“No, what courses?”</tutorial.roles.message.2_player1>
<tutorial.roles.message.2_player2>“Yes.” Skip to tutorial.</tutorial.roles.message.2_player2>
<tutorial.roles.message.3_skip>“All righty dude, just chill in the next room until the other students arrive. Lemme open that door for ya.”</tutorial.roles.message.3_skip>
<tutorial.roles.message.3_skip_player>“Great!”</tutorial.roles.message.3_skip_player>
<tutorial.roles.message.3>“Ah, you know dude, just the thingamajig politician dude in his ivory tower trying to solve a problem...without actually solving the problem, ya know?”</tutorial.roles.message.3>
<tutorial.roles.message.3_player>“What problem?”</tutorial.roles.message.3_player>
<tutorial.roles.message.4>“The submarine business—it ain't all that, you feel me? Ain't many that return from a trip. Ain't any that return from ten trips. So there's a 100% discount on whatever passes as education here, 'cus that'll solve things.”</tutorial.roles.message.4>
<tutorial.roles.message.4_player>“Are you bashing your own program?”</tutorial.roles.message.4_player>
<tutorial.roles.message.5>“I'm just the reception dude, dude. Ain't my job to get meat for the grinder. Want my advice? Take a station job—fight back against the system, dude.”</tutorial.roles.message.5>
<tutorial.roles.message.5_player>“But I want to find adventure! Besides, there's no food here...”</tutorial.roles.message.5_player>
<tutorial.roles.message.6a>“Suit yourself, dude... We offer five courses here:\n\nFirst off, the Captain. If ya feel like delegating all the shitty tasks, this is for you. Highly recommend.”</tutorial.roles.message.6a>
<tutorial.roles.message.6a_player>“Like the famous Herman Pollard!”</tutorial.roles.message.6a_player>
<tutorial.roles.message.6b>“Sure, dude. Then there's the fixin' duo.\nThe Engineer gets all the fancy toys, but with a high risk of bein' shocked. Ain't for the weak hearted.\nThen there's the Mechanic, if ya don't mind getting wet. He's doing the welding and pump-fixing kind of things. Ain't recommended for smokers, feel me?”</tutorial.roles.message.6b>
<tutorial.roles.message.6b_player>“Sounds like important jobs!”</tutorial.roles.message.6b_player>
<tutorial.roles.message.6c>“Yeah, awful right? Then there's the Security Officer, if you like shooting the creepies. They're usually too in love with their power, though. I actually got this tattoo that says ASOAB. Means 'All Security Officers Are Bastards.' Watch out with those dudes, dude.”</tutorial.roles.message.6c>
<tutorial.roles.message.6c_player>“They can't all be that bad?”</tutorial.roles.message.6c_player>
<tutorial.roles.message.6d>“Finally, there's the Medical Doctor. Most of 'em are creepier than the actual creepies, but some actually make people better, man. They're some literal saints, feel me?\nAnyhow, if ya still interested, move on to the next room.”</tutorial.roles.message.6d>

<tutorial.roles.objective.selection2>Leave the lounge area</tutorial.roles.objective.selection2>
<tutorial.roles.captaininstructor>“Hi. I am Captain Sterner. I will be your instructor today. I will start with a brief explanation of what it means to be a captain, followed by a practical course. It is crucial to enforce a chain of command, so you will address me as 'Captain.' Say 'Yes, Captain' if you understand.”</tutorial.roles.captaininstructor>
<tutorial.roles.yescaptain_player>“Yes, Captain!”</tutorial.roles.yescaptain_player>
<tutorial.roles.commandroomdescription>“The Command Room is the brains of the submarine. From here signals are passed—either verbally or electronically—to crew and devices.”</tutorial.roles.commandroomdescription>
<tutorial.roles.commandroomdescription2>“Using devices like the navigation terminal and status monitor, the captain can pass all these signals, for example: Order the crew to fix devices, signal the engine to move at full power, or empty the ballast tanks to raise the submarine.”</tutorial.roles.commandroomdescription2>
<tutorial.roles.navigationterminal>“The core function of the navigation terminal is to move the submarine.”</tutorial.roles.navigationterminal>
<tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_sonar>“Since we're in a low-light environment, sonar is the most efficient way of identifying terrain, objects and lifeforms.”</tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_sonar>
<tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_sonar2>“Sonar is short for 'sound navigation and ranging.' Sonar has two modes: passive and active.”</tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_sonar2>
<tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_sonar3>“While in 'passive' mode, the sonar only listens to sounds. It will still detect things, especially if these things make a lot of sound. Static objects or terrain, however, won't be detected until very close.”</tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_sonar3>
<tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_sonar4>“While in 'active' mode, the sonar emits pulses of sound at an interval. Simply put, this means every few seconds, the sound wave will reveal terrain, objects and lifeforms. Active sonar is essential to avoid bumping into terrain while moving at any decent speed.”</tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_sonar4>
<tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_sonar5>“Finally, there's the directional ping. While active sonar is great for spotting things, it's also great for being spotted. The directional ping limits the direction of the sound pulse, thus preventing hostiles from spotting your submarine—as long as it's not aimed at them.”</tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_sonar5>
<tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_sonar6>“We've hooked up this navigation terminal to a sonar. Feel free to try it out.”</tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_sonar6>
<tutorial.roles.popup.navigationterminal_sonar>Use [InputType.Select] to interact with the navigation terminal.</tutorial.roles.popup.navigationterminal_sonar>
<tutorial.roles.popup.navigationterminal_sonar2>Try out the sonar functionalities.</tutorial.roles.popup.navigationterminal_sonar2>
<tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_steering>“Once you have a bearing on your surroundings, it is time to move the submarine.”</tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_steering>
<tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_steering2>“Steering is controlled with the display in the middle, which utilizes modern touchcreen and auto-pilot technologies.”</tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_steering2>
<tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_steering3>“By default, the auto-pilot will try to maintain the submarine's position. By touching (clicking) the screen, the auto-pilot's target position will change to the indicated position.”</tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_steering3>
<tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_steering4>“Furthermore, the auto-pilot has information on outpost locations. It attempts to automatically navigate to predefined positions. This system, however, is neither infallible nor as quick as manual steering.”</tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_steering4>
<tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_steering5>“Speaking of manual steering: This is the preferred option for those who want more control over their submarine. By touching (clicking) the screen, you set the submarine's target velocity.”</tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_steering5>
<tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_steering6>“For example: If you want your submarine to move slowly to the right, you touch slightly to the right of the submarine's current position. If you want to rise up quickly, you touch far above the submarine's current position.”</tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_steering6>
<tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_steering7>“Ready to give it a try?”</tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_steering7>
<tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_steering8>“Trick question! No you're not, cadet! A submarine is usually docked while idle, to prevent it from drifting and using fuel. First, you'll need to undock using the big red "Undock" button. Easy, right? Now, let's try it out.”</tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_steering8>
<tutorial.roles.popup.navigationterminal_steering>Undock the drone, using the Shuttle Navigation Terminal.</tutorial.roles.popup.navigationterminal_steering>
<tutorial.roles.popup.navigationterminal_steering2>Practice steering the drone. Re-dock the drone when ready.\nTo dock, align the docking hatches (marked in green). Press Dock once the button flashes.</tutorial.roles.popup.navigationterminal_steering2>
<tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_commanding>“Not bad, cadet. You are ready to be a helmsman now, but being a captain is more than that.”</tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_commanding>
<tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_commanding2>“You cannot run a large submarine by yourself. You need a crew. And a crew needs someone to lead them, or they will stumble around like headless chickens. Cluck cluck cluck. Wait, they wouldn't... Never mind.”</tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_commanding2>
<tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_commanding3>“As captain, you're responsible for leading your crew. So you'll have to issue orders to them. Meaning, you'll need to know what needs doing!”</tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_commanding3>
<tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_commanding4>“That's where the status monitor comes in. With the status monitor, you can see where the submarine is in need of repairs. You can then mark these rooms with tasks and pray there's someone competent enough to perform them. Don't skip the praying part.”</tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_commanding4>
<tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_commanding5>“If you don't want shit to break down in the first place though, you'll have to tell your crew to keep it all in good order. This means issuing them orders from the get-go.”</tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_commanding5>
<tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_commanding6>“Let's try it out on an actual submarine, shall we? The other cadets ought to be ready right about now. Follow me.”</tutorial.roles.navigationterminal_commanding6>
<tutorial.roles.popup.captain_follow>Follow Captain Sterner into the submarine.</tutorial.roles.popup.captain_follow>
<tutorial.roles.captaininstructor_start>“We're here. Let's start by issuing commands to the crew. Without power, nothing in the submarine will work, so first order the reactor turned on.”</tutorial.roles.captaininstructor_start>
<tutorial.roles.popup.captain_command>Open the command interface with [InputType.Command].</tutorial.roles.popup.captain_command>
<tutorial.roles.popup.captain_command2>Order the reactor to be turned on.</tutorial.roles.popup.captain_command2>
<tutorial.roles.popup.captain_command3>The command interface will automatically select the most qualified crewmember for the assigned task.</tutorial.roles.popup.captain_command3>
<tutorial.roles.popup.captain_command4>You can also give orders directly to a specific crewmember on the crew list (toggle with [InputType.CrewOrders]).</tutorial.roles.popup.captain_command4>
<tutorial.roles.captaininstructor_repairs>“Great. Remember—captains should command respect and obedience. That's why they usually carry a firearm. Our last engineer, Stevie Dolittle, said, 'What are you going to do, shoot me?' Haha, his cousin didn't stick around long after that. Anyways, let's order some maintenance, shall we?”</tutorial.roles.captaininstructor_repairs>
<tutorial.roles.popup.captain_commandmaintenance>Order leaks to be fixed.</tutorial.roles.popup.captain_commandmaintenance>
<tutorial.roles.popup.captain_commandmaintenance2>Order electrical devices to be repaired.</tutorial.roles.popup.captain_commandmaintenance2>
<tutorial.roles.popup.captain_commandmaintenance3>Order mechanical devices to be repaired.</tutorial.roles.popup.captain_commandmaintenance3>
<tutorial.roles.captaininstructor_firearms>“And no, you won't be given a firearm yet—you'll have to complete your education first. Let's get on with that, shall we? Honkmother knows you'll need it. Speaking of firearms, it's time to get the sub's weapons operational.”</tutorial.roles.captaininstructor_firearms>
<tutorial.roles.popup.captain_commandsecurity>Order the bottom turret to be operated.</tutorial.roles.popup.captain_commandsecurity>
<tutorial.roles.captaininstructor_end>“That covers the basics. Now the real test: Undock from the station, get us to the next outpost, and you'll be done and graduated! Good luck, cadet!”</tutorial.roles.captaininstructor_end>

<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor>“Welcome! Welcome! I'm Chief Engineer Friar, but please, call me Kayleigh.”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor>
<tutorial.roles.reactorroomdescription>“The reactor room is where the heart of the submarine resides. As long as there's electrical juices flowing through the wires, there is life in the submarine. And it—the electricity—all originates from this beauty right here.”</tutorial.roles.reactorroomdescription>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_fuelrods>“While 'nuclear reactor' may sound scary, because of the whole invisible radiation thing, there's actually nothing to worry about! Operating reactors is relatively safe.”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_fuelrods>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_fuelrods2>“Relative to the other, waaaay more dangerous dangers, that is. The reactor room is usually quite well protected, and it's centrally located!”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_fuelrods2>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_fuelrods3>“One thing to keep in mind, and I will stress this: Do NOT insert every fuel rod you have in your storage into the reactor all at once.”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_fuelrods3>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_fuelrods4>“Really. Do not. Each fuel rod increases the amount of heat generated by the reactor. Too much heat means a fire will start. Eventually a full-blown meltdown will trigger, and...KABOOM! Well, at least it's a quick death. Sure beats getting captured by pirates.”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_fuelrods4>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_fuelrods5>“For now, I'm just going to hand you one fuel rod. Let me show you how to insert it.”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_fuelrods5>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_fuelrods5_player>“Is this really safe?”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_fuelrods5_player>
<tutorial.roles.popup.engineer_fuelrods>Interact with the reactor, then drag the fuel rod into the slots on the left.</tutorial.roles.popup.engineer_fuelrods>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactor>“A basic start-up of the nuclear reactor looks like this:\n1. One non-empty fuel rod inserted.\n2. Power button pressed.\n3. Automatic control toggled on.”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactor>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactor_player>“Sounds simple enough.”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactor_player>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactor2>“Give it a try then! Don't be shy!”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactor2>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactor2_player>“On it!”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactor2_player>
<tutorial.roles.popup.engineer_reactor>Interact with the reactor, power it up and enable automatic control.</tutorial.roles.popup.engineer_reactor>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactormanual>“Great job! You're a natural! We now have power. Look at how all the lights are turning on—that was all you!”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactormanual>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactormanual_player>“That was easy enough.”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactormanual_player>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactormanual2>“Aha, getting confident, are we? Well, let's switch over to manual control then.”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactormanual2>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactormanual3>“In manual control, you're using two controls. The first one, on the left, is the fission rate and the second, on the right, is the turbine output.”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactormanual3>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactormanual4>“Increasing the fission rate makes the reactor consume more fuel and generate more heat. The heat is used to spin the turbine, which generates electricity.”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactormanual4>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactormanual5>“The higher the turbine output, the more the reactor attempts to generate electricity. If the output is too high relative to the fission rate, the reactor will cool down; too low and it'll overheat.”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactormanual5>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactormanual6>“It all boils down to: Keep the left gauge in the green, keep the right gauge in the green.”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactormanual6>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactormanual6_player>“Why bother with manual control at all?”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactormanual6_player>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactormanual7>“Great question! Ever been on a submarine and the lights suddenly turned off? That probably meant the reactor was on automatic control and the captain did some sudden maneuvering. Auto is much slower to react to and compensate for higher power needs than manual control is.”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactormanual7>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactormanual7_player>“Can I try it?”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_reactormanual7_player>
<tutorial.roles.engineer_reactormanual>Interact with the reactor, then switch to manual control.</tutorial.roles.engineer_reactormanual>
<tutorial.roles.engineer_reactormanual2>Using the sliders, keep both needles of the gauges in the green areas.</tutorial.roles.engineer_reactormanual2>
<tutorial.roles.engineer_backtoauto>“Good job! Now, let's move on to the next room. But first, turn the automatic control back on. It's important not to leave the reactor on manual when it's unattended!”</tutorial.roles.engineer_backtoauto>
<tutorial.roles.engineer_followme>“All right, I think we're all done with the reactor now! Follow me.”</tutorial.roles.engineer_followme>
<tutorial.roles.electricaldescription>“Welcome to Electrical! Things are buzzing around here, aren't they?! Don't be intimidated by all the wires; they're going exactly where they need to go. I made sure of it.”</tutorial.roles.electricaldescription>
<tutorial.roles.electricaldescription2>“This room is usually filled with junction boxes. All the power from the reactor needs to be distributed, and that's where the jay-bees—or junction boxes—come in!”</tutorial.roles.electricaldescription2>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_junctionboxes>“When junction boxes break down, which they will, any devices connected to them will cease to function. Your job is to keep that from happening!”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_junctionboxes>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_junctionboxes_player>“Why do they break? Can't they, like, not break?”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_junctionboxes_player>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_junctionboxes2>“Good question! Some skilled engineers at outposts can make devices more damage resistant, but let's forget about that for now.”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_junctionboxes2>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_junctionboxes3>“Most captains are the rough breakey kind of captains. They prefer to accelerate at maximum power for a few seconds, then completely idle the submarine the next minute for a cigar break. These power fluctuations are what damages the sub's electrical devices most of the time.”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_junctionboxes3>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_junctionboxes4>“The other thing is water, of course. Electricity and water don't mix so well, so any time water leaks into the submarine, there will be damage.”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_junctionboxes4>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_junctionboxes4_player>“So I just sit here with my screwdriver for the whole trip?”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_junctionboxes4_player>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_junctionboxes5>“Pretty much! Except once you learn how to fast-repair, you'll have a lot of time for other things. Let me show you!”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_junctionboxes5>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_junctionboxes5_player>“Okay.”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_junctionboxes5_player>
<tutorial.roles.popup.engineer_junctionboxes>Interact with the junction box and click the repair button in rapid succession.</tutorial.roles.popup.engineer_junctionboxes>
<tutorial.roles.popup.engineer_junctionboxes2>Ouch! Repairing too quickly gets you shocked.</tutorial.roles.popup.engineer_junctionboxes2>
<tutorial.roles.popup.engineer_junctionboxes3>Now try to time clicking the repair button. Click when the moving line hits the colored area of the bar.</tutorial.roles.popup.engineer_junctionboxes3>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_wiring>“That went okay, I think. But look, this one light is still off!”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_wiring>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_wiring_player>“Why's that?”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_wiring_player>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_wiring2>“It's because I removed a wire connecting the junction box to the lamp. But I have it right here—I just need you to connect it.”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_wiring2>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_wiring2_player>“How?”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_wiring2_player>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_wiring3>“All you need is a screwdriver in one hand and a wire in the other. Let me show you!”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_wiring3>
<tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_wiring3_player>“Sure.”</tutorial.roles.engineerinstructor_wiring3_player>

<tutorial.airlocktitle>Airlock</tutorial.airlocktitle>
<tutorial.airlockdescription>Every submarine should be equipped with a secure airlock where the crew can exit the sub safely and without too much flooding.\n\nTo safely exit the submarine, equip a diving suit and other necessary items (usually a handheld sonar, weapons and extra oxygen tank or two). Then make your way to the airlock. Be sure to close all the doors behind you to stop the water’s flow before too much of it gets inside.\n\nWhen coming back inside, use water pumps to drain all of the water before going deeper into the submarine. It is also helpful to return all of the equipment back to their proper places and refill used oxygen tanks at the oxygen generator.</tutorial.airlockdescription>
<tutorial.railguntitle>Railgun</tutorial.railguntitle>
<tutorial.railgundescription>The railgun works like a coilgun, except it fires big shells that can be upgraded with explosives.\n\nRailgun loaders are loaded with single railgun shells instead of boxes of ammunition. Otherwise, operating them is the same: Interact with the periscope to aim with the turret, then press {0} to fire. Press {1} to stop aiming.</tutorial.railgundescription>
<tutorial.syringeguntitle>Syringe gun</tutorial.syringeguntitle>
<tutorial.syringegundescription>A ranged weapon of choice for medics, the syringe gun uses medicine as ammunition. This allows for administering cures from afar. Be aware: Medicines fired from long range are less effective than those used in the medical interface.\n\nA tactical choice in combat would be to load the syringe gun with poison and fire it at enemies. Aim the syringe gun the same way you would other long-range weapons: {0} to aim, {1} to fire.</tutorial.syringegundescription>
<tutorial.plasmacuttertitle>Plasma cutter</tutorial.plasmacuttertitle>
<tutorial.plasmacutterdescription>The plasma cutter is a device used to cut through walls and doors. It functions like the welding tool: {0} to aim, {1} to fire.\n\nWhile the plasma cutter is primarily a tool, it does inflict burns on anyone who gets in the way, which makes it a handy makeshift weapon.</tutorial.plasmacutterdescription>
<tutorial.crowbartitle>Crowbar</tutorial.crowbartitle>
<tutorial.crowbardescription>A heavy instrument that can be used to force open doors. Handy when someone has been tampering with door wiring or when you need to get to rooms you’re not allowed in. Use ({0}) the crowbar on a closed door to start prying it open. The crowbar must be equipped to do this.</tutorial.crowbardescription>
<tutorial.mineralstitle>Minerals</tutorial.mineralstitle>
<tutorial.mineralsdescription>The basic materials for crafting can be bought, deconstructed or found in the world.\n\nMinerals are spawned in the cave and ice walls, and they can be cut out using the plasma cutter and then picked up. Raw minerals can be deconstructed to create craftable elements.</tutorial.mineralsdescription>
<tutorial.psychosistitle>Psychosis</tutorial.psychosistitle>
<tutorial.psychosisdescription>When in contact with certain performance-enhancing drugs or under some extraterrestrial influence, players may be afflicted with psychosis, causing them to experience visual and auditory hallucinations and phantom pains.\n\nPsychosis may be cured using haloperidol.</tutorial.psychosisdescription>
<tutorial.opiatestitle>Opiate addiction and withdrawals</tutorial.opiatestitle>
<tutorial.opiatesdescription>Overuse of pain medication causes addiction and, in time, withdrawal. Withdrawal symptoms can be reduced by feeding the addiction, but to truly be rid of the effects, one must either stop taking the drugs entirely or use naloxone.</tutorial.opiatesdescription>
<tutorial.oxygentitle>Oxygen</tutorial.oxygentitle>
<tutorial.oxygendescription>Oxygen is a valuable commodity in underwater Europa. It must be readily available during long transits aboard submarines, which is made possible by oxygen generators. They pump air through ventilation to different rooms and can be used to refill oxygen tanks.\n\nTo refill oxygen tanks, interact ([InteractType.Use]) with the generator to open its inventory. Insert an empty oxygen tank into one of the slots to start refilling it. When the tank is full, drag it back to your inventory or into your diving suit/mask.</tutorial.oxygendescription>
<tutorial.laddertitle>Ladders</tutorial.laddertitle>
<tutorial.ladderdescription>To grab onto a ladder, press {0}. Use {1} and {2} buttons to climb the ladder. Let go of the ladder by pressing {3} again.</tutorial.ladderdescription>

<engineer.repairelectricalroomtext>Find the sub’s electrical room and repair the junction boxes by interacting with them while holding a screwdriver, then pressing the “Repair” button.</engineer.repairelectricalroomtext>
<engineer.powerupreactor>Reactor</engineer.powerupreactor>
<engineer.powerupreactorobjective>Power up submarine’s reactor</engineer.powerupreactorobjective>
<engineer.powerupreactortext>Nuclear reactors provide power to submarines and outposts. They require fuel to create heat and a crewmember to regulate the output.\n\nDrag a fuel rod to the item slot on the left side. Multiple fuel rods create more heat, but in normal circumstances one is enough and any more might cause the reactor to overheat.\n\nStart by setting the fission rate so that the needle is on green, then do the same for turbine output. You can see load and output values to the right. Try to keep the output as close to load as possible; a lower output can lead to power outages, and higher to overvoltage and fires.\n\nWhen the reactor operator leaves the interface, consider turning on automatic control. With automatic control, the reactor responds to any fluctuations in grid load, but it is considerably slower than a human operator.</engineer.powerupreactortext>

<!-- Captain tutorial -->
<captain.docktext>To dock the submarine, maneuver the ship’s and outpost’s docking ports close to each other and toggle the docking clamps. Ports are displayed in green on the sonar display.\n\nWhen the ports are close to each other, a line will be shown on the sonar display. When the line is fully green, close the clamps by pressing the “Dock” button. The submarine will then be locked into position until undocked.\n\nWhen positioning the submarine for docking, radical movements can easily cause you to overshoot your target. Using autopilot and “maintain position” is helpful in setting the position you want the submarine to move to.</captain.docktext>

<!-- Karma system -->
<karma>Karma</karma>
<karmaexplanation>Karma reflects the helpful and harmful actions you've taken while playing. Actions such as repairing the submarine, operating devices and killing monsters increase Karma, while actions such as attacking members of your crew or damaging the submarine decrease it.

<eventtext.givingdirections.c1>You almost run into someone wearing a captain’s uniform. You can tell by their appearance that they are a visitor here and their time hasn’t been pleasant. They’re studying a map closely and seem deeply concerned about what they see. A revolver hangs loosely from their belt. They mutter a quick apology before returning to the map.</eventtext.givingdirections.c1>
<eventtext.givingdirections.o1>“Hey, can I see that map? What’s the fastest route out of this shithole?”</eventtext.givingdirections.o1>
<eventtext.givingdirections.o1.c1>They scratch the back of their head. “That’s what I’m trying to find out. The problem is that there’s a long way to where we’re going and we’re short on supplies. Can’t exactly afford to go back either.”</eventtext.givingdirections.o1.c1>
<eventtext.givingdirections.o1.o1>“Let me take a look. We might be headed in the same direction.”</eventtext.givingdirections.o1.o1>
<eventtext.givingdirections.o1.o1.c1>Together you manage to find a shortcut to the next outpost. It’s a little on the dangerous side, but what isn’t? You bid the captain farewell.</eventtext.givingdirections.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.givingdirections.o1.o1.o1>A job well done.</eventtext.givingdirections.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.givingdirections.o1.o1.c2>Even with two pairs of eyes, you can’t find an easier route. You leave the captain, hoping their fortune turns soon.</eventtext.givingdirections.o1.o1.c2>

<eventtext.soundinthevent.o1.c1>You manage to get the vent off easily enough and spot the source of the noise right away: The fan blade is brushing against a small metal box. Carefully retrieving it, you open it and find 1,000 marks!</eventtext.soundinthevent.o1.c1>

<eventtext.soundinthevent.o3.c2>You decide you don’t have time for this nonsense and creep past the noisy vent. Not your problem! Whatever it is, someone else will sort that out!</eventtext.soundinthevent.o3.c2>
<eventtext.soundinthevent.o3.o2>Bah!</eventtext.soundinthevent.o3.o2>
<eventtext.soundinthevent.o3.c3>You decide you don’t have time for this nonsense and creep past the noisy vent, but you get the nagging feeling you've not seen the end of this yet...</eventtext.soundinthevent.o3.c3>
<eventtext.soundinthevent.o3.o3>A foreshadowing?</eventtext.soundinthevent.o3.o3>
<eventtext.impromptuengineering.c1>A nearby research terminal draws your attention. It flickers on and off rapidly for a while, then goes dark.</eventtext.impromptuengineering.c1>
<eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1>Diagnose.</eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1>
<eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.c1>You try pressing a couple buttons. No response. Opening a side panel reveals a tangle of wires and some kind of a processing unit seemingly in perfect condition.</eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.c1>
<eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o1>Scavenge for parts.</eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o1>
<eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o1.c1>You quickly unscrew the parts that look the most useful, carefully place them in your pocket and then put the panel back.</eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o1.o1>Finders keepers.</eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o1.c2>Whoever put this thing together did a poor job. You deem it impossible to salvage anything without taking the whole thing apart. While you’re elbow deep in the wiring, you hear footsteps approach. Panicking, you yank some wires out and slam the panel back in its place.</eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o1.c2>
<eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o1.o2>Act natural.</eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o1.o2>
<eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o2>Attempt to repair the terminal.</eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o2>
<eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o2.c1>You jiggle some display cables and the terminal comes back to life. Poking around the system reveals some opportunities. Looks like it’s connected to the outpost’s outfitting service. What do you want to do?</eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o2.o1>Request free coilgun ammunition.</eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o2.o1>
<eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o2.o1.c1>After clicking around a bit, you successfully order two boxes of coilgun ammunition for your vessel, free of charge.</eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o2.o1.c1>
<eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o2.o1.o1>This is what they have insurance for, right?</eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o2.o1.o1>
<eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o2.o2>Install an old-school first-person shooter on the system.</eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o2.o2>
<eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o2.o2.c1>You carry on the age-old tradition of installing the game on any platform possible. This accomplishes nothing except to give you a good feeling as you chuckle to yourself.</eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o2.o2.c1>
<eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o2.o2.o1>Mission complete.</eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o2.o2.o1>
<eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o2.c2>You try turning the terminal off and on again. Nothing. Now what? That’s the only thing you were taught to do and it usually solves the problem. Frustrated, you jiggle some wires behind the terminal when you feel a sharp pain shoot up your arm, along with a shower of sparks. You decide that’s enough injury for now.</eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o2.c2>
<eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o2.o3>Ouch.</eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o2.o3>
<eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o3>Back away. There have to be some nerds around here who get paid to fix these things.</eventtext.impromptuengineering.o1.o3>
<eventtext.impromptuengineering.o2>Ignore.</eventtext.impromptuengineering.o2>
<eventtext.clownrelations1.c1>Someone has left a toolbelt in the middle of the hallway.</eventtext.clownrelations1.c1>
<eventtext.clownrelations1.o1>Inspect.</eventtext.clownrelations1.o1>
<eventtext.clownrelations1.o1.c1>The box contains bike horns, masks and oversized shoes. As you’re rummaging through it, a posse of people dressed in clown suits march down the hallway. One of them walks straight up to the box, picks it up and stares at you, then at your hand. You realize you’re still holding a bike horn in your hand.</eventtext.clownrelations1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.clownrelations1.o1.o1>Apologize and put the horn back in the box.</eventtext.clownrelations1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.clownrelations1.o1.o1.c1>The jester turns around stoically and continues on with the group, leaving you to scratch your head.</eventtext.clownrelations1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.clownrelations1.o1.o2>Honk the horn.</eventtext.clownrelations1.o1.o2>
<eventtext.clownrelations1.o1.o2.c1>You raise the horn to your eye level and squeeze it. Instantly, chaos erupts among the group of clowns. They applaud, prance around and giggle uncontrollably, as if the sound of the horn were the funniest thing imaginable. One of them ruffles your hair approvingly.</eventtext.clownrelations1.o1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.clownrelations1.o2>Better not.</eventtext.clownrelations1.o2>
<eventtext.clownrelations2.c1>A clown is loitering nearby. When he sees you approach, he perks up and tries to get your attention.</eventtext.clownrelations2.c1>
<eventtext.clownrelations2.o1>See what he has to say.</eventtext.clownrelations2.o1>
<eventtext.clownrelations2.o1.c1>The jester reaches out to you. In a similar motion, you raise your own arm and simultaneously you both honk each other’s noses. Twice, as is tradition when meeting a new brother. Without saying a word, he reaches into his pack and hands you a brand new bike horn. He salutes you and leaves, his footsteps squeaking rhythmically.</eventtext.clownrelations2.o1.c1>
<eventtext.clownrelations2.o1.c2>Before you can react, the loathsome harlequin reaches out and painfully honks your nose.</eventtext.clownrelations2.o1.c2>
<eventtext.clownrelations2.o1.o1>Truly, they are a scourge on Europa.</eventtext.clownrelations2.o1.o1>
<eventtext.clownrelations2.o2>Avoid eye contact.</eventtext.clownrelations2.o2>
<eventtext.goodsamaritan.c1>You come across an unconscious worker. There are no signs of violence and nobody else is around.</eventtext.goodsamaritan.c1>
<eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1>Diagnose.</eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1>
<eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.c1>The patient’s lips are blue, their breaths are short and shallow and their heart is beating very slowly. Telltale signs of Fentanyl overdose. Injection marks on their arm confirm your diagnosis.</eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.c1>
<eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.o1>Treat the overdose with Naloxone.</eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.o1>
<eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.o1.c1>You treat the overdose with Naloxone. The patient is still unconscious, but their condition is stable.</eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.o1.c2>You have no Naloxone. All you can do at this point is make sure the patient's life is not in immediate danger and alert the local officials.</eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.o1.c2>
<eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.o2>Give them basic first aid and alert the outpost doctor.</eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.o2>
<eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.o2.c1>You make sure the patient is stable and decide to let the local officials deal with the rest.</eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.o2.o1>Good job.</eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.o2.o1>
<eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.c2>Well, he's unconscious all right. Probably just sleeping off a hangover or something.</eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.c2>
<eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.o3>Eh, that's the best I can do for now.</eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.o3>
<eventtext.goodsamaritan.o2>Check their pockets.</eventtext.goodsamaritan.o2>
<eventtext.goodsamaritan.o2.c1>You find some spare change in their pocket, but a passerby catches you in the act. It seems looting injured people is frowned upon here.</eventtext.goodsamaritan.o2.c1>
<eventtext.goodsamaritan.o3>Step over their body and continue on.</eventtext.goodsamaritan.o3>
<eventtext.propaganda.c1>A row of posters line the wall. It looks like the outpost directorial election is coming up. A gallery of stern-looking people are observing the hallway, conveniently grouped according to their political affiliation.</eventtext.propaganda.c1>
<eventtext.propaganda.o1>Inspect the posters.</eventtext.propaganda.o1>
<eventtext.propaganda.o1.c1>Some of the Coalition Party’s boards have fallen victim to vandalism. “Bring power back to the hands of the people!” and “Down with the oligarchy!” are some of the catchphrases spray-painted on candidates’ faces. Separatists up to their usual tricks.</eventtext.propaganda.o1.c1>
<eventtext.propaganda.o1.o1>Add some of your own flair too.</eventtext.propaganda.o1.o1>
<eventtext.propaganda.o1.o1.c1>You draw some vulgar art of your own, then quickly move on before the fascists catch you in the act.</eventtext.propaganda.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.propaganda.o1.o1.o1>That'll show them.</eventtext.propaganda.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.propaganda.o1.o2>Keep walking.</eventtext.propaganda.o1.o2>
<eventtext.propaganda.o2>Not interested in outpost politics.</eventtext.propaganda.o2>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.c1>As you’re walking down the hallway, you catch a whiff of something sweet.</eventtext.goblincooking1.c1>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1>“Who’s cooking?”</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.c1>You sniff around and find the aroma coming from a nearby vent. Suddenly you feel very hungry.</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1>Try to find the source.</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.c1>You peer into the dark vent, trying to find out where it leads. No avail—the vents here are all connected. Even if you were to, say, climb in and follow the smell, you’d stand no chance of finding the sau–, er…source.</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1>“Climb in the vent? Good idea!”</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1.c1>It takes you no effort to remove the vent cover and wriggle inside. The smell is now intoxicating and it seems to come from every direction. Desperate, you start crawling. Eventually the vent splits into two paths. Something clicks in your head. This isn’t right.</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1.o1>“I’ve come this far. Might as well keep going.”</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>You pick a direction and crawl on. Suddenly it doesn’t smell so good anymore. The aroma has gradually turned into a sickly sweet, rotten stink. You start panicking as the tight walls begin closing in. Your vision blurs and everything goes dark. The last thing you see is a vaguely humanoid shape squirming toward your helpless body.</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>Goodbye.</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>The next thing you know, you wake up outside the vent. Strangely, the vent is screwed shut and there are no signs of anyone having entered it. A quick inspection reveals you're uninjured, but your pockets are empty of change.</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1.o2>Turn back.</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1.o2>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1.o2.c1>With great effort, you manage to turn around and make your way back to where you entered. While unhurt, you have a feeling you brought back something with you from the vents.</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1>“At least it's over now.”</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o2>“What a fool I would be if I climbed in there…”</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o2>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o2.c1>You chuckle at the idea of climbing into an air vent in a strange outpost in search of food. Even so, it takes some effort to leave the vent and the alluring aroma within.</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o2.o1>Now to get back to business.</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o2.o1>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o2>Ignore the siren call of the scent.</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o2>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o2>Ignore the aroma.</eventtext.goblincooking1.o2>
<eventtext.outbreak.c1>You overhear someone nearby talking to a radio. “Yeah, I gave them the eggs. Uh huh… Yeah. I made sure they swallowed ‘em. ...I don’t know, maybe three minutes ago?” That’s weird, you think to yourself. Hopefully nothing weird comes out of this.</eventtext.outbreak.c1>
<eventtext.outbreak.o1>OK.</eventtext.outbreak.o1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1>Pay him.</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.c1>You sit down at the table opposite Mike. A pungent smell of alcohol wafts from him. “Come on, then. What d’you wanna know about?”</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o1>“What’s the meaning of life?”</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o1.c1>Mike conjures up a bottle of booze. “Real original.” He takes a swig. “There are a few schools of thought, but basically it boils down to this: Either you make life good for yourself or do good by others.” He reaches over the table to offer you a drink and knocks down a few bottles in the process. They shatter on the floor. “Shit.” Mike slumps down dejectedly. “There’s no God,” he mutters as he pushes himself up and starts for the cleaning closet. “Session’s over.”</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o1.o1>All right.</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o2>“What do you reckon is in the center of Europa?”</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o2>
<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o2.c1>Mike blinks. “What? I don’t know. Lava? Or is it magma in this case?” He turns toward a bunk. “Hey Jimmy! Is it lava if it’s underground or magma?” A bundle of sheets stirs a bit. “What is–? Fuck off Mike, I’m sleeping,” it mumbles back. Mike scratches the back of his head. “It’s gotta be one or the other. What else could it be?” He chuckles and flashes his rotting teeth. “A gateway to Earth? Ridiculous.”</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o2.o1>Yeah, I guess it is.</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o2.o1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o3>“What’s up with the clowns?”</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o3>
<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o3.c1>“Funny little fuckers, aren’t they?” Mike leans back in his chair. It squeaks in protest. “The legend has it that a cargo ship carrying entertainment supplies wrecked somewhere near Uusi-Turcu. They recovered a single survivor weeks later. She was wearing a striped shirt, rubber mask and gibbering something about a 'Honkmother' who had kept her company.” He picks his nose and pensively inspects his findings. “Ever since, there’s been a group of ‘em what worships the Honkmother.” “Really?” you ask, enthralled. He flicks the booger off. “No. But that’s all I got.”</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o3.c1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o3.o1>...I want my money back.</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o3.o1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o2>Back out.</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o2>
<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o2>Ignore all charlatans.</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o2>
<eventtext.miketheidiot2.c1>You run into a familiar face. It seems Mike the fortune teller has found his way here. This time he’s wearing a janitor’s overalls and is in the process of mopping up a puddle of what seems like someone’s former breakfast.</eventtext.miketheidiot2.c1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1>“Moving up in the world, eh?”</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.c1>“Oh, hey. Yeah, I figured it was time to bounce after the... You know, the incident. With the reactor.” You decide not to delve deeper. “I still have plenty of wisdom to dispense. 5 marks or a pack of cigarettes.”</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.c1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1>Pay up.</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.c1>He leans on his mop. “So what can I help you with?”</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o1>“How’s Earth?”</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o1.c1>Mike takes out a cigarette and puts it in his mouth. “Guess it’s still out there. A bit worse for wear though, am I right?” He flashes a toothless smile and fishes out a lighter from his pocket. “I had a pen pal there a few years back, you know? A real prolific writer. No wonder, you ought to get a lot of writing done with twelve fingers.” He lights the cigarette, takes a drag and coughs his lungs out. “Fuck me!” He exclaims after the fit subsides. “People really smoke these things?” He tosses the whole pack in the trash. “Not for me.”</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o1.o1>Good to know.</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o2>“What happened to Mantises?”</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o2>
<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o2.c1>“Oh, them? Natural selection. Some things are just better suited for survival.” He rolls up his sleeve, revealing a crude tattoo that states: “I fuck with boots on.” He continues: “Tougher. Faster. Prettier. Only the strong come out on top.” A passerby tosses a soda can on the floor and Mike bends to pick it up. “Apex predators, that’s what we are,” he declares as he places the can in the trash.</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o2.o1>Truth.</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o2.o1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o3>“Why would someone shoot a man before throwing him out of an airlock?”</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o3>
<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o3.c1>“It’s all part of the plan,” Mike muses. “Sending a message. You gotta assert dominance, otherwise you get no respect.” He gets back to mopping the puke off of the floor. “It’s how you survive on a submarine, same as in prison.” “You were incarcerated?” you ask. “Oh, I’ve been all around. I tell you, the things you have to do to get respect... I still have trouble walking straight.”</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o3.c1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o3.o1>That's too much info.</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o3.o1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o2>Act like someone’s calling you on the radio.</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o2>
<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o2>Sneak by.</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o2>
<eventtext.miketheidiot.nomoney>“Mike knows many things, and he'll tell you some. But only if you have the coin.”</eventtext.miketheidiot.nomoney>
<eventtext.firefighting.c1>You notice a thin trail of smoke rising from a trash can.</eventtext.firefighting.c1>
<eventtext.firefighting.o1>Investigate.</eventtext.firefighting.o1>
<eventtext.firefighting.o1.c1>There is a lit cigarette in the trash. It seems dangerously close to igniting a larger flame.</eventtext.firefighting.o1.c1>
<eventtext.firefighting.o1.o1>Put it out.</eventtext.firefighting.o1.o1>
<eventtext.firefighting.o1.o1.c1>You get some minor burns when you fish the cigarette out and stomp out the fledgling fire, but nothing major.</eventtext.firefighting.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.firefighting.o1.o2>See what happens.</eventtext.firefighting.o1.o2>
<eventtext.firefighting.o2>Not my problem.</eventtext.firefighting.o2>
<eventtext.sleightofhand.c1>Some workers are huddled together, playing a game with dice. They have piled various items together, presumably as prizes for the winner. Among them is a shiny, symmetrical item. You recognize it as alien, and probably worth more than the other items combined.</eventtext.sleightofhand.c1>
<eventtext.sleightofhand.o1>Join the game and attempt to win the item for yourself.</eventtext.sleightofhand.o1>
<eventtext.sleightofhand.o1.c1>You quickly deduce that it’s a game of pure luck. You take a few careful risks and it pays off. You walk away with the prized alien ornament.</eventtext.sleightofhand.o1.c1>
<eventtext.sleightofhand.o1.c2>Unsurprisingly, the other players are more experienced in the game than you. After betting a sizeable amount of cash, you walk away with nothing. You have lost 500 marks.</eventtext.sleightofhand.o1.c2>
<eventtext.sleightofhand.o2>Create a distraction and try to snatch it without anyone noticing.</eventtext.sleightofhand.o2>
<eventtext.sleightofhand.o2.c1>You start yelling “Fire! Fire!” and quickly grab the item in the ensuing chaos. You hide it deep in your pocket. It’s time to go before they’re any wiser.</eventtext.sleightofhand.o2.c1>
<eventtext.sleightofhand.o2.c2>You start yelling “Fire! Fire!” and quickly grab the item in the ensuing chaos. However, one of them catches you in the act and calls security.</eventtext.sleightofhand.o2.c2>

<eventtext.foreshadowing.c1>You feel the faintest of tugs near your pants. When you finally get some space, you find someone has slipped a note in your pocket.</eventtext.foreshadowing.c1>
<eventtext.foreshadowing.o1>Read it.</eventtext.foreshadowing.o1>
<eventtext.foreshadowing.o1.c1>It states: “The truth is out there. cbspusbvnbhbnf.dpn/efsfmjdu/beweht.htm”</eventtext.foreshadowing.o1.c1>

<eventtext.separatistrelations.o1>Confront them.</eventtext.separatistrelations.o1>
<eventtext.separatistrelations.o1.c1>“Hey! That’s official property!” you decide to yell. The youngsters stop what they’re doing and attack you.</eventtext.separatistrelations.o1.c1>
<eventtext.separatistrelations.o2>Help them.</eventtext.separatistrelations.o2>
<eventtext.separatistrelations.o2.c1>You act as a lookout for the two activists. When they finish their masterpiece, you exchange a few words. They deem you loyal to their cause and promise to put a good word in for you.</eventtext.separatistrelations.o2.c1>
<eventtext.separatistrelations.o3>Ignore them.</eventtext.separatistrelations.o3>
<eventtext.huskcultrelations.c1>Someone is handing out flyers advertising some kind of a communion. You spot a familiar-looking logo in the corner. It’s just the local husk cult members proselytizing. It might be fun to check out the ritual.</eventtext.huskcultrelations.c1>
<eventtext.huskcultrelations.o1>Sure, what’s the worst that could happen?</eventtext.huskcultrelations.o1>
<eventtext.huskcultrelations.o1.c1>You make your way into the advertised dorm. It’s the usual stuff: “Fleshbags” this and “ascension” that. The local chapter guys are very friendly and they invite you to partake of the communion.</eventtext.huskcultrelations.o1.c1>
<eventtext.huskcultrelations.o1.o1>“Don’t mind if I do.”</eventtext.huskcultrelations.o1.o1>
<eventtext.huskcultrelations.o1.o1.c1>You gulp down some husk eggs. A bit salty. Afterwards you joke around with the folks a bit and you part in good spirits.

<eventtext.engineers_are_special.c1.o1.c1>You decline as tactfully as you can but he’s clearly not happy. He shakes his head and silently goes back to work, trying to refit the engine.</eventtext.engineers_are_special.c1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.engineers_are_special.c1.o2>Help him with his engine.</eventtext.engineers_are_special.c1.o2>
<eventtext.engineers_are_special.c1.o2.c1>You roll up your sleeves and get to work refitting the engine with him. After a few minutes of work you both manage to get it running. “Thanks. I’m sure I’d have got it going on my own eventually but you’ve saved me some time. Let me know if you want any work done on your sub and I’ll see about giving you a little discount for your trouble.”</eventtext.engineers_are_special.c1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.engineers_are_special.c1.o2.c2>You roll up your sleeves and get to work refitting the engine with him. In spite of your best efforts though, the engine refuses to start. He slams shut the access panel. “Well I guess this is one for the scrappers. Thanks for the help anyhow.”</eventtext.engineers_are_special.c1.o2.c2>
<eventtext.engineers_are_special.c1.c2>He clearly doesn’t care much for what he sees and returns to his work. Apparently you’ve somehow not passed muster.</eventtext.engineers_are_special.c1.c2>
<eventtext.mediator.c1>Two workers are arguing loudly. What once might have been a civil discussion about inter-Europan politics has devolved into a shouting match—it isn’t readily apparent how the other guy’s mother factors into it.</eventtext.mediator.c1>
<eventtext.mediator.o1>Try to calm the situation down.</eventtext.mediator.o1>
<eventtext.mediator.o1.c1>You move a bit closer. For a moment, the two loudmouths stop arguing and look at you.</eventtext.mediator.o1.c1>
<eventtext.mediator.o1.o1>“Hey fellas. Not my place to interrupt, but they can hear your conversation back in Versas.”</eventtext.mediator.o1.o1>
<eventtext.mediator.o1.o1.c1>The two workers are humbled by your parental demeanor. They quiet down and get back to their duties.</eventtext.mediator.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.mediator.o1.o1.c2>They are even more pissed off now, but this time at you. Your condescending manner of speaking does you no favors.</eventtext.mediator.o1.o1.c2>
<eventtext.mediator.o1.o2>“I suggest you two shut your traps before I finish counting to three. One…”</eventtext.mediator.o1.o2>
<eventtext.mediator.o1.o2.c1>They get the feeling you have the means to back up your words. The two workers go quiet in a record time.</eventtext.mediator.o1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.mediator.o1.o2.c2>They look at you bemusedly.</eventtext.mediator.o1.o2.c2>
<eventtext.mediator.o1.o2.o1>Two...</eventtext.mediator.o1.o2.o1>
<eventtext.mediator.o1.o2.o1.c1>They look at each other. Clearly, they’re shaking in their boots.</eventtext.mediator.o1.o2.o1.c1>
<eventtext.mediator.o1.o2.o1.o1>Three.</eventtext.mediator.o1.o2.o1.o1>
<eventtext.mediator.o1.o2.o1.o1.c1>A smile appears on the other’s face and you smile at him in turn. You feel powerful. Your smile quickly turns into a frown when they grab their tools and walk toward you with ill intent.</eventtext.mediator.o1.o2.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.mediator.o2>Egg them on.</eventtext.mediator.o2>
<eventtext.mediator.o2.c1>You don’t know exactly what’s going on, but join in the shouting anyway. “Remember what he said about your mom?” “That shit doesn’t fly where I’m from!” You feel giddy as the shouting crescendos into a fistfight and the two workers start reaching for their tools. It might be a good time to vanish from the area.</eventtext.mediator.o2.c1>
<eventtext.mediator.o3>Nothing to see here. Keep walking.</eventtext.mediator.o3>
<eventtext.blackmarket.c1>“Hey! Got something for ya here if you’re interested…”</eventtext.blackmarket.c1>
<eventtext.blackmarket.o1>Listen to what they have to say.</eventtext.blackmarket.o1>
<eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c1>“I happened to find some nice alien contraband. It’s yours for 1,000 marks. I’ll throw in a power cell too. What do you say?” He opens his coat to reveal a pistol that looks like genuine alien tech.</eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c1>
<eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c1.c1>Do you want to buy the pistol for 1,000 marks?</eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c1.c1>
<eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c1.o1>Yes, please.</eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c1.o1>
<eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c1.o1.c1>He hands you the pistol. It’s a genuine article.</eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c1.o1.c2>He shoves the pistol in your hand and quickly shuffles off. On a closer look, the pistol is actually a children’s toy. You angrily toss it aside.</eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c1.o1.c2>
<eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c1.o2>No thanks.</eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c1.o2>
<eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c2>“I found some weird eggs in the vents. Dunno what they are but figured they’d mean something for someone like you.” He flashes some eggs but it’s too dark to make out which species. He quickly hides them before you can ascertain their nature. “500 marks.”</eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c2>
<eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c2.c2>Do you want to buy the eggs for 500 marks?</eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c2.c2>
<eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c2.o1>Yes, please.</eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c2.o1>
<eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c2.o1.c1>He carefully places the eggs in your hand. Most of them are actually oversized marbles, but one is a genuine mudraptor egg. “This can potentially cause a lot of damage,” you think to yourself as you stow it safely inside your jacket.</eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c2.o1.c1>
<eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c2.o1.c2>In the light, the eggs are instantly recognizable as “Velonaceps calyx,” otherwise known as husk eggs.</eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c2.o1.c2>
<eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c2.o2>No thanks.</eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c2.o2>
<eventtext.blackmarket.o2>Ignore.</eventtext.blackmarket.o2>
<eventtext.blackmarket.nomoney>“Not enough cash? I thought the submarine business paid well...”</eventtext.blackmarket.nomoney>
<eventtext.huskcultist.c1>“Hello, fellow traveler!” a pale figure greets you. You’re slightly taken aback by their cheerfulness. “Would you happen to have any eggs of the species Velonaceps calyx? I’ll pay good money for each one you come across in your travels.” Their facade momentarily slips and you can hear them muttering under their breath. You can make out “disgusting meatsack” and something about “ascending.”</eventtext.huskcultist.c1>
<eventtext.huskcultist.o1>Check your pockets for eggs.</eventtext.huskcultist.o1>
<eventtext.huskcultist.o1.c1>You check your pockets. As luck would have it, you have some husk eggs on you.</eventtext.huskcultist.o1.c1>
<eventtext.huskcultist.o1.o1>Sell the eggs for 1,000 marks.</eventtext.huskcultist.o1.o1>
<eventtext.huskcultist.o1.o1.c1>You exchange the eggs for money, which you count immediately. It's all there.</eventtext.huskcultist.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.huskcultist.o1.o2>Give the eggs for free.</eventtext.huskcultist.o1.o2>
<eventtext.huskcultist.o1.o2.c1>You decide to donate the eggs for free. The person seems overjoyed.</eventtext.huskcultist.o1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.huskcultist.o1.o3>Actually, I'll keep these for now.</eventtext.huskcultist.o1.o3>
<eventtext.huskcultist.o1.c2>You check your pockets. You're fresh out of husk eggs.</eventtext.huskcultist.o1.c2>
<eventtext.huskcultist.o1.o4>“I don't have the eggs on me but I'll go get some.”</eventtext.huskcultist.o1.o4>
<eventtext.huskcultist.o1.o4.c1>“I'll be here,” the person whispers. It sends shivers down your spine.</eventtext.huskcultist.o1.o4.c1>
<eventtext.huskcultist.o1.o5>“Sorry, don't have any.”</eventtext.huskcultist.o1.o5>
<eventtext.huskcultist.o2>Uhh...probably best to keep moving.</eventtext.huskcultist.o2>
<eventtext.fanclub.c1>A crowd of teens has gathered to observe the newcomers to their outpost. They’re loudly arguing about which is the coolest job on board a submarine.</eventtext.fanclub.c1>
<eventtext.fanclub.o1>Talk to them.</eventtext.fanclub.o1>
<eventtext.fanclub.o1.c1>They have an endless amount of questions. You answer them diligently, and in the end you have the feeling a few of them are going to grow up to be seafarers. Remember: If they wind up as crawler food, it’ll be blood on your hands.</eventtext.fanclub.o1.c1>
<eventtext.fanclub.o2>Ignore them.</eventtext.fanclub.o2>
<eventtext.huskcultambush.c1>Two pale characters with bags under their eyes approach. They’re reaching for something under their clothes. You feel threatened.</eventtext.huskcultambush.c1>
<eventtext.huskcultambush.o1>“Hey, fellas. What’s—uh... What’s this?”</eventtext.huskcultambush.o1>
<eventtext.huskcultambush.o1.c1>The two figures draw out sharp knives and lunge at you.</eventtext.huskcultambush.o1.c1>
<eventtext.huskcultambush.o2>“Easy, dear brothers. My time for ascension isn’t here yet.”</eventtext.huskcultambush.o2>
<eventtext.huskcultambush.o2.c1>They stop their approach, apologize for the confusion and the three of you grab some crawler cocktails and laugh it off. They share information on this outpost.</eventtext.huskcultambush.o2.c1>
<eventtext.huskcultambush.o2.c2>The two figures draw out sharp knives and lunge at you.</eventtext.huskcultambush.o2.c2>
<eventtext.missionevent_cargo_campaignstart.c1>“We've sold some basic construction materials to the neighbouring outpost, but delivery is on us. A simple transport job; perfect for a new crew like yourselves. What say you?”</eventtext.missionevent_cargo_campaignstart.c1>
<eventtext.missionevent_cargo1.c1>“We hired a crew to transport these materials, but they never showed. The stuff is still here if you want the job.”</eventtext.missionevent_cargo1.c1>
<eventtext.missionevent_cargo2.c1>“Got some real 'handle with care' cargo sitting in the bay. Normally I wouldn't trust them with any new face but I hear you've proved yourselves.”</eventtext.missionevent_cargo2.c1>
<eventtext.missionevent_cargo3.c1>“These research materials are sorely needed in the neighboring outpost. It's imperative they get to their destination intact.”</eventtext.missionevent_cargo3.c1>
<eventtext.missionevent_killswarm.c1>“No transport ship can leave without running into a swarm of monsters. Take care of the problem and there's a reward in it for you.”</eventtext.missionevent_killswarm.c1>
<eventtext.missionevent_killmonstercommon.c1>“There's this especially mean monster terrorizing the caves near here. I've put a little reward aside for the crew that takes it down.”</eventtext.missionevent_killmonstercommon.c1>
<eventtext.missionevent_killmonsterrare.c1>“I've heard reports of a gargantuan monster somewhere in the vicinity. If you want to try hunting it down, be my guest. Just make sure you're prepared. It's a dangerous one.”</eventtext.missionevent_killmonsterrare.c1>
<eventtext.missionevent_salvageartifact.c1>“We picked up a signal nearby. The eggheads say it could be something alien. If you check it out, there'd be some marks in it for you.”</eventtext.missionevent_salvageartifact.c1>
<eventtext.missionevent_salvageartifactabyss.c1>“We picked up a faint signal in the depths. The eggheads are pretty sure it's an alien artifact. If you check it out, there'd be some marks in it for you.”</eventtext.missionevent_salvageartifactabyss.c1>
<eventtext.missionevent_salvagewreck.c1>“We received a distress signal from a vessel that was carrying some sensitive cargo. The contents are probably long gone by now but the captain's logbook should shed some light on what happened to it. I want you to recover it.”</eventtext.missionevent_salvagewreck.c1>
<eventtext.missionevent_killmonster.c1>“I posted about an assignment earlier. Sent the details to your onboard navigation system too, in case you're interested.”</eventtext.missionevent_killmonster.c1>
<eventtext.missionevent_cargo.c1>“I posted about an assignment earlier. Sent the details to your onboard navigation system too, in case you're interested.”</eventtext.missionevent_cargo.c1>
<eventtext.missionevent_cargo_difficult.c1>“Got some real 'handle with extreme caution' cargo sitting down at the docks. This won't be your average transport job, as magnetic suspension crates keep the very volatile contents from a violent and explosive reaction. Ensure the crates are powered throughout the journey, and you will be fine. Think you can handle this?”</eventtext.missionevent_cargo_difficult.c1>
<eventtext.missionevent_salvage.c1>“I posted about an assignment earlier. Sent the details to your onboard navigation system too, in case you're interested.”</eventtext.missionevent_salvage.c1>
<eventtext.missionevent_clownoutbreak.c1>There are flyers with notices for various jobs. One of them is for ferrying a few boxes of clowning equipment to a neighboring outpost. It states: “If interested, imitate your favorite bird.”</eventtext.missionevent_clownoutbreak.c1>
<eventtext.missionevent_clownoutbreak.o1>“Krruu!”</eventtext.missionevent_clownoutbreak.o1>
<eventtext.missionevent_clownoutbreak.o1.c1>A distant sound of a bike horn confirms you as the recipient of the assignment. A container is waiting for you when you leave the outpost.</eventtext.missionevent_clownoutbreak.o1.c1>
<eventtext.missionevent_clownoutbreak.o2>“Caw! Caw!”</eventtext.missionevent_clownoutbreak.o2>
<eventtext.missionevent_clownoutbreak.o2.c1>A distant sound of a bike horn confirms you as the recipient of the assignment. A container is waiting for you when you leave the outpost.</eventtext.missionevent_clownoutbreak.o2.c1>
<eventtext.missionevent_clownoutbreak.o3>Stay silent.</eventtext.missionevent_clownoutbreak.o3>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1>An announcement comes over the PA. “Calling the crew of the vessel that just docked. Please send a representative to see the security chief in administration.”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1>“You're one of the new arrivals? Good. I have a sensitive issue I can't trust any of my own employees with.” The chief pauses for a second, sizing you up, then continues. “In usual circumstances, I wouldn't ask for help from just anyone, but I'm running out of options. Needless to say, I need you to keep this to yourself. Are you interested?”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.o1>“Tell me more.”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.o1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.o1.c1>The chief nods. “According to intel we managed to gather earlier, we can expect a separatist prison break soon,” they state, matter-of-factly. “Prison breaks are already a nasty business, but to complicate matters I have reason to believe they have a man on the inside.”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.o1.o1>“Pun intended?”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.o1.o1.c1>“I'm talking about inside the security force.” It seems like sense of humor isn't how one makes it to chief of security. “To cut to the chase, I need to make sure all my personnel are on the level and take precautions. Here's what I want you to do. Take these microphones and hide them in the crew quarters.”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.o1.o1.o1>Accept the mission.</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.o1.o1.o1.c1>You pick up some small surveillance microphones. “One more thing. I can't permit this kind of surveillance in an official capacity. If you get caught, you're on your own.”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.o1.o1.o2>“I'd rather not get involved.”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.o1.o1.o2>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.o2>“I'd rather not get involved.”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.o2>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.c1>These must be the quarters the chief was talking about.</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.c1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1>Hide microphones under the bunks.</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.c1>You quickly stuff the mics in footlockers under the bunks. The sound coming through is a bit muffled but serviceable. Return to the chief to receive your payment.</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.c1.c1>“Good work. Here's your payment. We never spoke.”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.c1.c1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.c2>You toss the mics under a bunk. When you turn around to leave, you run into a security guard. “What are you up to?” they ask.</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.c2>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.o1>“Oh, just some calisthenics. Need to stay in shape for emergencies.”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.o1.c1>The guard seems satisfied with the explanation and goes back to their rounds. Return to the chief to receive your payment.</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.o1.c1.c1>“Good work. Here's your payment. We never spoke.”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.o1.c1.c1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.o1.c2>“You look like you've never done an honest day's work in your life.” They start inspecting undersides of the bunks. Now would be a good time to vanish before they get any wiser. This mission is a failure.</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.o1.c2>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.o1.c2.c2>The guard draws their weapon. “Microphones, huh? You need to come with me.” Now would be a REALLY good time to run.</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.o1.c2.c2>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.o2>“Just installing some surveillance mics.”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.o2>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.o2.c1>The guard lets out a brief chuckle. “A funny guy. You shouldn't be here. Go on, git.” The guard then turns their attention to the cameras. Now would be a good time to vanish before they get any wiser. This mission is a failure.</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.o2.c1.c1>The guard draws their weapon. “Microphones, huh? You need to come with me.” Now would be a REALLY good time to run.</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.o2.c1.c1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o2>Hide microphones inside some electronics.</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o2>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o2.c1>You open up a nearby transistor radio and install a microphone inside the speaker, out of sight. Return to the chief to receive your payment.</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o2.c1.c1>“Good work. Here's your payment. We never spoke.”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o2.c1.c1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o2.c2>You spot a transistor radio that could possibly hold a microphone. As you're fiddling with it, a security guard calls out. “You! Come here!” You decide to comply for now. “What were you doing?” the guard demands.</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o2.c2>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o2.o1>“Fixing the radio antenna.”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o2.o1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o2.o1.c1>“Finally. Make sure K-Rawler comes through loud and clear.” Something will come through all right, you think to yourself. Return to the chief to receive your payment.</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o2.o1.c1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o2.o1.c1.c1>“Good work. Here's your payment. We never spoke.”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o2.o1.c1.c1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o2.o2>“Just installing some surveillance mics.”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o2.o2>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o2.o2.c1>The guard lets out a brief chuckle. “A funny guy. You shouldn't be here. Go on, git.” The guard then turns their attention to the cameras. Now would be a good time to vanish before they get any wiser. This mission is a failure.</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o2.o2.c1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o2.o2.c1.c1>The guard draws their weapon. “Microphones, huh? You need to come with me.” Now would be a REALLY good time to run.</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o2.o2.c1.c1>
<eventtext.tastetest.c1>In a nearby trash can, there are two small bottles of clear liquid. Both of them are labeled with a different chemical formula.</eventtext.tastetest.c1>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1>Take a closer look at the bottles.</eventtext.tastetest.o1>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.c1>Neither solution is anything you’re especially familiar with, but you are reasonably sure one of them is strongly acidic. You decide to leave the acid be. The other bottle is a total mystery to you.</eventtext.tastetest.o1.c1>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.o1>Bottoms up!</eventtext.tastetest.o1.o1>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.o1.c1>The solution has a slightly mellow and sweet quality to it and it leaves a lingering aftertaste of apricot. It seems to have no other effects. You decide to leave the bottles in the trash and continue on.</eventtext.tastetest.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.o1.o1>Not bad.</eventtext.tastetest.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.o1.o1.c1>After a while, you realize drinking the solution has made all your pains disappear. For the first time in forever, you feel good. You don't know what the solution is but you wish you had some more. Maybe there's some more in the trash?</eventtext.tastetest.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.o1.o1.o1>Maybe I should take another look in there.</eventtext.tastetest.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>You return to the trash can and find a couple more bottles. None of them are the same as the one you drank but maybe they can be of some other use.</eventtext.tastetest.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.o2>Not a very sensible thing to do...</eventtext.tastetest.o1.o2>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.c2>Chemistry makes no sense to you; it might as well be an alien language. After a quick shake test, either liquid seems perfectly safe to you. One of them has a blue label, the other green. Do you want to try one of them?</eventtext.tastetest.o1.c2>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.o3>Blue label.</eventtext.tastetest.o1.o3>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.o3.c1>The solution has a slightly mellow and sweet quality to it and it leaves a lingering aftertaste of apricot. It seems to have no other effects. You decide to leave the bottles in the trash and continue on.</eventtext.tastetest.o1.o3.c1>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.o3.o1>Not bad.</eventtext.tastetest.o1.o3.o1>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.o3.o1.c1>After a while, you realize drinking the solution has made all your pains disappear. For the first time in forever, you feel good. You don't know what the solution is but you wish you had some more. Maybe there's some more in the trash?</eventtext.tastetest.o1.o3.o1.c1>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.o3.o1.o1>Maybe I should take another look in there.</eventtext.tastetest.o1.o3.o1.o1>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.o3.o1.o1.c1>You return to the trash can and find a couple more bottles. Maybe one of these is the same miracle solution!</eventtext.tastetest.o1.o3.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.o4>Green label.</eventtext.tastetest.o1.o4>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.o4.c1>The liquid burns your throat a bit when you swallow it. At first, the effect isn’t unlike a good Jovian vodka, and the prospect of getting buzzed while spending no money appeals to you greatly. The situation suddenly takes a turn for the worse when you feel like your stomach is on fire. A sharp pain causes you to double over in agony. Who would’ve thought drinking something out of the trash was a bad idea?</eventtext.tastetest.o1.o4.c1>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.o4.o1>Not good.</eventtext.tastetest.o1.o4.o1>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.o5>No, of course not!</eventtext.tastetest.o1.o5>
<eventtext.tastetest.o2>Ignore.</eventtext.tastetest.o2>
<eventtext.crawleroutbreak.c1>A panicked researcher runs past you. “God dammit Jimmy, I told you we should’ve went with padlocks instead of these electronic pieces of shit!”</eventtext.crawleroutbreak.c1>
<eventtext.consultant.c1>As you step inside the office, the manager notices you. “I suppose you're here about the situation in the mines?” he asks.</eventtext.consultant.c1>
<eventtext.consultant.o1>“Uh...sure. Remind me what the situation was, again?”</eventtext.consultant.o1>
<eventtext.consultant.o1.c1>It turns out the miners have halted the work in the mines because of a toxic gas leak. “They're demanding ridiculous hazard pay and we just don't have the budget for that. That's why you're here, right? To negotiate a better deal?”</eventtext.consultant.o1.c1>
<eventtext.consultant.o1.o1>“Yes, that's right. Get me in contact with the foreman.”</eventtext.consultant.o1.o1>
<eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1>“They can probably be found near the main mineshaft. Good luck.”</eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1.c1>The foreman is pacing back and forth, loudly arguing with someone on the radio. You only catch the tail end of their discussion. “There aren't enough diving masks for the whole crew. Even if there were, we couldn't waste the oxygen keeping them on all day long. ...No, the ventilation in the mines is connected to the rest of the outpost so we can't risk pumping it out either.” Exasperated, he looks at you. “Are you here about the gas leaks?”</eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1.c1>
<eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1.o1>Haggle for lower hazard pay for miners.</eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1.o1>
<eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1.o1.c1>You successfully explain that not everyone can be paid extra for hazardous work. This will probably result in most of the crew walking out and the rest having to work their asses off, but at least you got paid a hefty consultant fee.</eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1.o1.c2>The foreman stands their ground. No hazard pay, no digging. At least you tried.</eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1.o1.c2>
<eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1.o2>“What kind of gases are we talking about?”</eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1.o2>
<eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1.o2.c1>“Mercury gases. Colorless, odorless, gives you breathing problems real quick.”</eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1.o2.o1>Come up with a solution to help with mercury exposure.</eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1.o2.o1>
<eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1.o2.o1.c1>“A combination of iron, Stabilozine and crawler liver should keep your lungs clean of mercury.

<eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1.o3.c1>“The ducts reach from here all the way to the mess hall and dorms, meaning we can't pump the vapors out. I don't know who installed them originally, but I'd like to have a word with 'em.”</eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1.o3.c1>

<eventtext.huskcultist_return.o1>Yes.</eventtext.huskcultist_return.o1>

<eventtext.stowaway1.c1>Hmm. This box wasn't here before.</eventtext.stowaway1.c1>
<eventtext.stowaway1.o1>Investigate.</eventtext.stowaway1.o1>
<eventtext.stowaway1.o1.c1>It is a regular storage crate found all over Europa, identical to the ones you receive your supplies in. You bend down and try to open it. However, as you start lifting the lid, something slams it back down.</eventtext.stowaway1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.stowaway1.o1.o1>“Hello?”</eventtext.stowaway1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.stowaway1.o1.o1.c1>No response.</eventtext.stowaway1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.stowaway1.o1.o1.o1>Listen closely.</eventtext.stowaway1.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.stowaway1.o1.o1.o1.c1>You hold your breath and put your ear next to the crate. You can hear rustling from inside.</eventtext.stowaway1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.stowaway1.o1.o1.o1.o1>Forcefully remove the lid.</eventtext.stowaway1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.stowaway1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>You successfully wrestle the lid off. To your surprise, a small crawler jumps out ready to claw your eyes out!</eventtext.stowaway1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.stowaway1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c2>You successfully wrestle the lid off. Lying on top of a saline shipment is a small creature. It eyes you carefully, then crawls out of the crate and looks at you expectantly. It seems like you have made a friend.</eventtext.stowaway1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c2>
<eventtext.stowaway2.c1>Noises are coming out of this cabinet. As you approach it, they grow quiet.</eventtext.stowaway2.c1>
<eventtext.stowaway2.o1>Investigate.</eventtext.stowaway2.o1>
<eventtext.stowaway2.o1.c1>When you open the cabinet door, a harlequin in unusual garb steps out. They greet you formally and explain that they are a messenger.</eventtext.stowaway2.o1.c1>
<eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o1>“What is your message?”</eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o1>
<eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o1.c1>The jester explains that there is a sunken submarine nearby. It was carrying an item of tremendous value to the Honkmother. The messenger doesn't wait for your answer. Instead, they turn on their heels and leave you to ponder.</eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.stowaway2.o1.c2>You carefully open the cabinet door, only to reveal a mouth-agape, wide-eyed young person hiding in it. By the looks of them, they are in their late teens.</eventtext.stowaway2.o1.c2>
<eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o2>“Who are you?”</eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o2>
<eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o2.c1>“N-nobody special, I guess,” the teen stammers.</eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o2.c1>

<eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o2.o1.c1>“Me and a couple of friends snuck on board while you were visiting [location].

<eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o2.o1.o1>“What am I going to do with you?”</eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o2.o1.o1>
<eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o2.o1.o1.c1>“W-well, I'd like to go back home. If you don't want to go back, I guess I can hop onto a shuttle on the next station.”</eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o2.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o2.o1.o1.o1>“I'm taking you back home.”</eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o2.o1.o1.o1>

<eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o2.o1.o1.o2>“You'll get off at the next stop.”</eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o2.o1.o1.o2>
<eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o2.o1.o1.o3>“Come out. You're working for me now.”</eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o2.o1.o1.o3>
<eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o2.o1.o1.o3.c1>“Are you serious?” the teen whines. Yes, you are. That'll teach them to sneak on board strange vessels.</eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o2.o1.o1.o3.c1>
<eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o2.o2>“Stay there. I'll be back later.”</eventtext.stowaway2.o1.o2.o2>
<eventtext.shockjock.c1>A radio is blaring nearby. A man with a raspy voice is yelling about something.</eventtext.shockjock.c1>
<eventtext.shockjock.o1>Listen.</eventtext.shockjock.o1>
<eventtext.shockjock.o1.c1>“Well we've all heard about this nonsense about so-called clown brutality. As if for some reason clowns are being sought out and roughed up because of how they look. Let me tell you, it's got nothing to do with the color of their makeup and everything to do with how they choose to carry themselves!”</eventtext.shockjock.o1.c1>
<eventtext.shockjock.o1.o1.c1>In fact, in this latest incident, I can only imagine how it would have unfolded if the jester in question had been wearing a suit and a tie instead of oversized shoes and a ridiculous wig! And instead of running away, they could've gone 'Yes, sir,' 'No, sir,' and they'd be on their merry way right now! But no. The take-away here, dear listeners, is: Clown around and your brains will end up all over the walls.”</eventtext.shockjock.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.shockjock.signoff>“And that's all the time we have for now. Remember, listen and obey. Maurice! Hold the cards up! Maur— No! What does that even mean?” The person in the booth sounds very irate. “Maurice, I swear to— What do I even pay you for?” The broadcast suddenly stops and is replaced by static.</eventtext.shockjock.signoff>
<eventtext.shockjock.o1.c2>“Recreational drug use is on the rise, people. Have you heard about “Cult of the Husk”? A bunch of weirdos abusing biohazardous materials? And the establishment does nothing about it!”</eventtext.shockjock.o1.c2>
<eventtext.shockjock.o1.o2.c1>“And don't get me started on casual opioid use that's rampant everywhere! According to trusted sources, the Coalition is putting something in them, making them addicting! Before too long, it'll be your children, squatting away in abandoned outposts, wearing dirty robes, doing whatever substances they can get their grubby hands on.”</eventtext.shockjock.o1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.shockjock.o1.c3>“Dear listeners, if I was the Coalition president, I would walk right into the crew quarters, set up my little podium and say, 'Listen, citizens, if you vote against military spending and a separatist army marches in and blows you up, we're not going to do anything about it.'”</eventtext.shockjock.o1.c3>
<eventtext.shockjock.o1.o3.c1>“You want to cry about your ruined little station? Give us your money next time! Anyway, that's what I would say, if I was the president.”</eventtext.shockjock.o1.o3.c1>
<eventtext.shockjock.o1.c4>“What a bunch of bullshit. Don't believe everything you hear on the radio.”</eventtext.shockjock.o1.c4>
<eventtext.shockjock.o1.o4>“What was that broadcast about?”</eventtext.shockjock.o1.o4>
<eventtext.shockjock.o1.o4.c1>“It's some weird hermit who's built a makeshift radio station somewhere. Nobody knows where, otherwise somebody would have put a stop to it already. The guy gets on everybody's nerves.”</eventtext.shockjock.o1.o4.c1>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra1.c1>(Hmm? What's this?)</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra1.c1>

<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra2.o1>“No, who's that?”</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra2.o1>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra2.o1.c1>“Jacov Subra. He's a weird guy who put together these—how should I put it—'themed' festivals.” The person rolls their eyes. “Full of husks.

<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra2.o1.o1.c1>“They caught him here a week ago. From what I heard, he had held another disastrous festival nearby, and was sent to the mines.”</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra2.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra2.o1.o1.o1>“That's good news.”</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra2.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra2.o1.o1.o1.c1>“Good news, until he slipped away again.” A tone signals that the break is over. The worker puts the paper away and starts toward the dock. “I hear they put up a reward for whoever brings him to custody,” they yell over their shoulder.</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra2.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra2.o2>“What's he done now?”</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra2.o2>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra2.o3>“Don't address me, trash.”</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra2.o3>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra3.c1>“Welcome to the annual 'Church of the Mollusc' festival! Featuring: Sonata Aquatica, Jethro Hull, Irma-Donna, Draft Bunk and many more! With a special appearance by Sacov Jubra!” The word “mollusc” is written on top of a scribbled out “husk.” Seems like the festival is being held nearby. A passerby exclaims: “Draft Bunk is playing! Sweet!”</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra3.c1>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra3.o1>Interesting.</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra3.o1>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.c1>“You'll never take me alive!”</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.c1>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1>“Give up, Jacov! You're coming with me!”</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.c1>“I'm not going anywhere! I'm innocent! Look, I'll pay you!”</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.c1>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o1>“Save it for the judge.”</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o1>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o1.c1>“Been there, done that.” Jacov smiles devilishly. “What makes you think I won't run away again?”</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o1.o1>“Not my problem.”</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o1.o1.c1>“I can see your heart isn't in this. I'll give you three thousand marks and you let me walk out of here. Deal?”</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.deal>“Deal.”</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.deal>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.neversaw>“Here's the money. We never saw each other.”</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.neversaw>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.nodeal>“No deal. Come along now, quietly.”</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.nodeal>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.run>As soon as the words leave your lips, Jacov hurls a fistful of coins at your head and turns to run away.</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.run>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o1.o2>“Maybe I'll put a bullet in your leg.”</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o1.o2>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o1.o2.c1>Jacov is sweating profusely. “Surely you wouldn't shoot an unarmed man?”</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o1.o2.o1>“Absolutely I would.” (Attack)</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o1.o2.o1>

<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o1.o2.o2.c1>Fine, I'll come quietly.</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o1.o2.o2.c1>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o2>“How much?”</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o2>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o2.c1>“Three thousand for you and we part as friends, right here.”</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o2>“Wasn't trying to. (Attack)”</eventtext.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o2>
<eventtext.infiltration.c1>The station manager looks at you with haggard eyes. “You're one of the new arrivals? Man, am I glad to see a non-masked face.”</eventtext.infiltration.c1>
<eventtext.infiltration.o1>“Now that you mention it, there are a lot of masks around.”</eventtext.infiltration.o1>
<eventtext.infiltration.o1.c1>“A bunch of clowns. Let me ask you, you ever wake up in the middle of the night to a sound of bike horns? They don't even attempt any kind of melody, just honking away all willy-nilly. I haven't had a full night's sleep in...days?” They stare blankly into space. “Weeks?”</eventtext.infiltration.o1.c1>
<eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1>“Sounds horrible. What do they want?”</eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1>
<eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.c1>“Who knows? I've tried talking to them, offering money, threatening to kick them out, you name it, I've tried it. I think they're content with torturing me and the rest of the crew.”</eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1>Offer to help.</eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.c1>“The manager scoffs. “Tell you what. You get them to leave, there's a...” Their eyes narrow as they study you. “Thousand marks for you. One more thing. No physical violence. While I personally wouldn't shed any tears for roughed up clowns, we have rules here we adhere to.”</eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o1>“Not even a little?”</eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>“No.”</eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2>“Got it.”</eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2>
<eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.c1>You approach a clown. They stare at you.</eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1>Threaten the clown.</eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1>
<eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1.c1>You stare the clown down for a minute. They try to grab your nose but you slap their arm away. You point to the direction of the airlock. With slumped shoulders, the clown shuffles away, their friends in tow.</eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1.c1>
<eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1.o1>Mission complete.</eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1.o1>
<eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1.o1.c1>It's suddenly very quiet. You report your success to the manager on the radio and one thousand marks are deposited to your account.</eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1.c2>You strain to flex your biceps. For some reason this only succeeds in making the clown laugh in your face and continue their merriments.</eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1.c2>
<eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1.o2>Mission failed.</eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1.o2>
<eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1.o2.c1>You have missed your chance at making an impactful impression and dejectedly report failure to the station manager.</eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o2>Build rapport.</eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o2>
<eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o2.c1>You try to reason with the clowns, explaining that their behaviour is disrupting the lives of the crew here and frankly, quite unacceptable. Your words fall to deaf ears.</eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o2.c1>
<eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o2>“Well, good luck with that.”</eventtext.infiltration.o1.o1.o2>
<eventtext.infiltration.o2>“Don't speak to me, you harlequin-hater.”</eventtext.infiltration.o2>
<eventtext.badvibrations1.c1>A sound of shattering glass makes you jump. Someone is slouched against the wall, shards of glass at her feet. By the looks of it, it might have been a bottle of rum she was holding. She's muttering under her breath.</eventtext.badvibrations1.c1>
<eventtext.badvibrations1.o1>“You okay?”</eventtext.badvibrations1.o1>
<eventtext.badvibrations1.o1.c1>No response. You notice she's repeating the same thing over and over. “Bad vibrations, man. Bad vibes.” Drool is slowly dripping from the corner of her mouth onto her jacket.</eventtext.badvibrations1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.badvibrations1.o1.o1>Try to help her.</eventtext.badvibrations1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.badvibrations1.o1.o1.c1>You're wondering about the person's mental health, when they unexpectedly swing around and grab you by the collar. “Bad vibrations, do you hear me?” A sudden realization dawns on her when she recognizes you as a member of a submarine crew. “You can help me,” she pleads. “We found a relic. Turned it on. In the structure. Deep.” She lets up her grasp on you for a second.</eventtext.badvibrations1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.badvibrations1.o1.o1.o1>“You're making no sense.”</eventtext.badvibrations1.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.badvibrations1.o1.o1.o1.c1>The madness seems to have found it's way back to cloud her mind. “I was first! I know! I got the trophy!”</eventtext.badvibrations1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.badvibrations1.stepback>Take a step back.</eventtext.badvibrations1.stepback>
<eventtext.badvibrations1.raving>You wonder what the person is raving about. A relic inside a structure? Something in the ruins? You make a note to check it out if you have time.</eventtext.badvibrations1.raving>
<eventtext.badvibrations1.notmyproblem>Not my problem.</eventtext.badvibrations1.notmyproblem>
<eventtext.badvibrations2.c1>Touching the artifact's etched surface causes an almost imperceptible itch inside your head.</eventtext.badvibrations2.c1>
<eventtext.badvibrations2.o1>Drop the artifact.</eventtext.badvibrations2.o1>
<eventtext.badvibrations2.o1.c1>For some reason, you find it very difficult to drop the item, and it remains in your hands. The itch builds up into a slight vibrating feeling in your skull.</eventtext.badvibrations2.o1.c1>
<eventtext.badvibrations2.o1.o1>Throw away the artifact.</eventtext.badvibrations2.o1.o1>
<eventtext.badvibrations2.o1.o1.c1>It's as if you've forgotten how to move your arms. Your head feels uncomfortably warm and numb. It's getting more and more challenging to keep your focus on anything.</eventtext.badvibrations2.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.badvibrations2.o1.o1.o1>Sleep.</eventtext.badvibrations2.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.badvibrations2.o1.o1.o1.c1>You close your eyes. This seems like as good a place as any to have a nap. Jupiter knows you've earned one. You let yourself fall back into a dreamless sleep.</eventtext.badvibrations2.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.badvibrations2.inspect>Inspect the artifact more closely.</eventtext.badvibrations2.inspect>
<eventtext.badvibrations2.protrusion>As you run your hands across the item's surface, you hit a protrusion. At once, the numbness inside subsides and you are again fully aware of your surroundings. Time to get this artifact somewhere it can be kept safe.</eventtext.badvibrations2.protrusion>
<eventtext.badvibrations3.c1>Somebody is trying to get your attention. “Hey! I've been looking for you.” She looks vaguely familiar. “You don't remember me, do you?”</eventtext.badvibrations3.c1>
<eventtext.badvibrations3.o1>“Oh yeah, you're the one with the, uh, vibrations.”</eventtext.badvibrations3.o1>
<eventtext.badvibrations3.gotbetter>“So, I got better. Suppose that is because you turned the thing off?” She crosses her arms. “Wanted to come say thanks.”</eventtext.badvibrations3.gotbetter>
<eventtext.badvibrations3.welcome>“You're welcome.”</eventtext.badvibrations3.welcome>
<eventtext.badvibrations3.anotherthing>“There's another thing. Because I was...unwell, I got booted from the crew I was with back then. I was thinking I could join up with you guys? I'm pretty handy with all things mechanical or electrical.” She looks strong and capable now that she's not being hindered by an external influence.</eventtext.badvibrations3.anotherthing>
<eventtext.badvibrations3.merrier>“Sure. The more the merrier.”</eventtext.badvibrations3.merrier>
<eventtext.badvibrations3.seeyouonboard>“Great. I'll see you on board.”</eventtext.badvibrations3.seeyouonboard>
<eventtext.badvibrations3.full>“Sorry, we're full for now.”</eventtext.badvibrations3.full>
<eventtext.badvibrations3.hangout>“Well, I guess I'll hang out here 'til I find something.”</eventtext.badvibrations3.hangout>
<eventtext.badvibrations3.reward>Ask for a reward.</eventtext.badvibrations3.reward>
<eventtext.badvibrations3.scrounge>“Oh. Uh, I can scrounge up a few hundred marks if you like. I'll send 'em to you as soon as possible.”</eventtext.badvibrations3.scrounge>
<eventtext.badvibrations3.o2>“You're the fortuneteller, right?”</eventtext.badvibrations3.o2>
<eventtext.badvibrations3.o2.c1>“Huh?” She looks confused and mildly annoyed. “No, you're mistaking me with someone else. I ran into you earlier when I was still having...trouble with a certain relic. You know, with the 'bad vibes' and all.”</eventtext.badvibrations3.o2.c1>
<eventtext.badvibrations3.o2.o1>“Now I remember.”</eventtext.badvibrations3.o2.o1>
<eventtext.manandhisraptor1.c1>A distressed looking person is pacing in circles in the hall. When they see you, their eyes light up. “You're from that sub that just docked, aren't you? Do you take passengers?”</eventtext.manandhisraptor1.c1>
<eventtext.manandhisraptor1.o1>“I am indeed. What type of passengers?”</eventtext.manandhisraptor1.o1>
<eventtext.manandhisraptor1.o1.c1>“Just me and Rex. We're supposed to visit nana in the next town over, but for some reason nobody wants us on board.” The person can't keep eye contact for more than a second and keeps glancing over their shoulder.</eventtext.manandhisraptor1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.manandhisraptor1.o1.o1>Be suspicious.</eventtext.manandhisraptor1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.manandhisraptor1.o1.o1.c1>There are always vessels traveling these waters, eager to make some extra moolah by taking on passengers. You open your mouth, trying to voice your suspicions about the situation. “Wh—” you start, but the person interrupts you. “I'll pay you three thousand. One when we leave, two when we get there.”</eventtext.manandhisraptor1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.manandhisraptor1.takeonboard>Take the person on board.</eventtext.manandhisraptor1.takeonboard>
<eventtext.manandhisraptor1.great>“Great!” they exclaim. “I'll get Rex and we'll meet you on board!” What a happy fellow. Hopefully their money is good.</eventtext.manandhisraptor1.great>
<eventtext.manandhisraptor1.o2>“Nope.”</eventtext.manandhisraptor1.o2>
<eventtext.manandhisraptor2.c1>You're inspecting the sub when the person you talked to at the station peeks out from a cabin, with a wide smile on their face. “You ready to meet Rex?” Before you can utter a response, the biggest mudraptor you've ever seen jumps out behind them.</eventtext.manandhisraptor2.c1>
<eventtext.manandhisraptor2.o1>“Watch out!”</eventtext.manandhisraptor2.o1>
<eventtext.manandhisraptor2.o1.c1>You yell out and reach for a weapon, but the creature only tilts its head and looks at you quizzically. “Isn't he a cutie?” This is Rex? They brought a mudraptor on board? “Be careful, though. Rex gets ornery on long trips. Don't you, boy? Yes you do!” Great.</eventtext.manandhisraptor2.o1.c1>
<eventtext.manandhisraptor2.c1.c1>Rex is pacing back and forth.</eventtext.manandhisraptor2.c1.c1>
<eventtext.heartofgold.c1>As you approach, this bandit throws down their weapon. “Ah fuck it, I give up. Don't shoot!”</eventtext.heartofgold.c1>
<eventtext.heartofgold.o1>“Too late for that. Say your prayers.”</eventtext.heartofgold.o1>
<eventtext.heartofgold.o1.c1>The bandit reaches for their weapon on the ground. “Do your worst!”</eventtext.heartofgold.o1.c1>
<eventtext.heartofgold.o2>Talk to them.</eventtext.heartofgold.o2>
<eventtext.heartofgold.o2.c1>“Thanks for not offing me, I guess.” The bandit squats down and wipes sweat off his brow. “I've never fired that, you know,” he says, pointing to the gun on the floor. “Not cut out for this shit.”</eventtext.heartofgold.o2.c1>
<eventtext.heartofgold.goodluck>“Well, good luck with everything.”</eventtext.heartofgold.goodluck>
<eventtext.heartofgold.wait>“Wait!” The bandit cries out and jumps to their feet. “Can I come with you? I know a lot about chemistry. I could cook you meds!”</eventtext.heartofgold.wait>
<eventtext.heartofgold.okay>“Okay, I suppose.”</eventtext.heartofgold.okay>
<eventtext.heartofgold.signingbonus>“All right! We can sort out a signing bonus later.”</eventtext.heartofgold.signingbonus>
<eventtext.heartofgold.whatamigonnado>“Well what am I gonna do then? Wait 'till another sub comes through guns blazing?”</eventtext.heartofgold.whatamigonnado>
<eventtext.heartofgold.onyourown>“You're on your own.”</eventtext.heartofgold.onyourown>
<eventtext.heartofgold.o2.o2>“What are you even doing here?”</eventtext.heartofgold.o2.o2>
<eventtext.heartofgold.o2.o2.c1>“I was captured along with the rest of my crew and sub. They're all gone now.” They scowl. “Eaten. They were used as bait for the crawlers that used to inhabit this place. I was spared because I know how to make morphine and fent.”</eventtext.heartofgold.o2.o2.c1>
<eventtext.heartofgold.o2.o2.o1>“You're a drug dealer?”</eventtext.heartofgold.o2.o2.o1>
<eventtext.heartofgold.o2.o2.o1.c1>“Give me a break. Like you haven't done any opiates yourself? The way I see it I provided a service and, in return, nobody pointed a gun my way.” A dry smile creeps on their face. “Until you, that is.”</eventtext.heartofgold.o2.o2.o1.c1>
<eventtext.bombscare.c1>“Hey, you there.”</eventtext.bombscare.c1>
<eventtext.bombscare.o1>“Me?”</eventtext.bombscare.o1>
<eventtext.bombscare.o1.c1>The guard takes a long look at you. “Never mind. I thought you looked like someone else. You're free to go.”</eventtext.bombscare.o1.c1>
<eventtext.bombscare.o1.o1>“What's going on?”</eventtext.bombscare.o1.o1>
<eventtext.bombscare.o1.o1.c1>“Just be careful,” the guard cautions. “We received a bomb threat a few hours ago, by some usual suspects. It's been a while and no bomb has been found, but we advise caution.”</eventtext.bombscare.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.bombscare.o1.o1.o1>“Usual suspects?”</eventtext.bombscare.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.bombscare.o1.o1.o1.c1>The guard lowers their voice. “Look, you better stay clear of this separatist business. There have been some serious attacks lately. Just come to me if you see something suspicious.”</eventtext.bombscare.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.bombscare.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.c1.c1>You thrust the bomb to the arms of the guard, who flinches a bit. You recount your experience and the guard thanks you for finding the bomb and gives you a small reward for dismantling it.</eventtext.bombscare.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.c1.c1>
<eventtext.bombscare.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o1.c1.c1>You report finding a bomb in the hallway and the guard immediately springs to action. They thank you for finding and reporting the bomb.</eventtext.bombscare.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o1.c1.c1>
<eventtext.bombscare.o1.o2>Leave the guard.</eventtext.bombscare.o1.o2>
<eventtext.terrorism101.c1>You see a person crouched next to a vending machine, assembling or fixing something.</eventtext.terrorism101.c1>
<eventtext.terrorism101.o1>Find out what they're working on.</eventtext.terrorism101.o1>
<eventtext.terrorism101.o1.c1>You sneak behind the person and crane your neck. It seems they're fiddling with some kind of a device with lots of wires. They glance back and jump up when they see you. “Shit! Don't just stand there!”</eventtext.terrorism101.o1.c1>
<eventtext.terrorism101.o1.o1>“Sorry.”</eventtext.terrorism101.o1.o1>
<eventtext.terrorism101.o1.o1.c1>“It's all right, I guess.” They check their pulse and exhale deeply. “I've been a wreck ever since my medication was pulled. Couldn't afford it, they said. Then they went ahead and installed these fuckin' things.” Irate, the dweller kicks the vending machine.</eventtext.terrorism101.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.terrorism101.o1.o1.o1>“So what are you doing?”</eventtext.terrorism101.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.terrorism101.excuse>“I, uh...” Their eyes dart around, looking for something. “I'm building a, um...” They're sweating profusely.</eventtext.terrorism101.excuse>
<eventtext.terrorism101.abomb>“A bomb?”</eventtext.terrorism101.abomb>
<eventtext.terrorism101.shh>“SHHH! Not so loud!” they hiss. Then they continue, whispering. “Yes, it's a bomb. But it's also so much more. It's a symbol of discontent against our overlords. We must topple the monuments of oppression, like this one here.” They spit on the vending machine. “But that's hypothetical at this point, 'cause I don't actually know how to arm this symbol.”</eventtext.terrorism101.shh>
<eventtext.terrorism101.help>“I could help you with that.”</eventtext.terrorism101.help>
<eventtext.terrorism101.novice>The novice terrorist scrutinizes you for a minute, then warily hands you a bunch of wires. “I think I can trust you,” they say.</eventtext.terrorism101.novice>
<eventtext.terrorism101.armbomb>Arm the bomb.</eventtext.terrorism101.armbomb>
<eventtext.terrorism101.bombarmed>It's only a matter of connecting the detonator wire to get the bomb armed. You hand the bomb to the person and they give you some change and a promise to talk you up to their Separatist friends.</eventtext.terrorism101.bombarmed>
<eventtext.terrorism101.dismantlebomb>Quietly dismantle the bomb.</eventtext.terrorism101.dismantlebomb>
<eventtext.terrorism101.bombdismantled>You pretend to arm the bomb, but instead you remove some of the wires, making sure the bomb can't go off. The person hands you some change as a reward and promises to talk you up to their Separatist friends.</eventtext.terrorism101.bombdismantled>

<eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.c1>This colony is in a hurry. Lots of workers are loading supplies onto submarines.  You see a pair of them arguing quietly and gesturing toward you.</eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.c1>
<eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1>Walk up to them.</eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1>
<eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.c1>On your approach, the pair instantly quiets down. Up close you can see an anarchist patch on one of their jackets, revealing them to be separatists. “Didn't you help us out earlier?” the other asks.</eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.c1>
<eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1>“Yep, that's me.”</eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1>
<eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.c1>“You see all that crew running around? A lot of subs here are readying for a dive.”</eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1>“I wonder where they're going.”</eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.c1>“Yeah, so do we. We sent one of ours to the office to find out.” The speaker shifts their weight and pauses for a bit. “They haven't come back yet, and I'm getting worried. Might've been caught doing something they shouldn't have.”</eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1>“I could find out.”</eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>“Not a bad idea. Officials here don't know you yet. Just sneak in, see what you can see. Whatever it is, don't cause a scene.”</eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>“Wouldn't dream of it.”</eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>“Oh, and if our guy ask you if you've had Versas liver, the answer is 'It's to die for.'”</eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>“Got it.”</eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>

<eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>Check on them.</eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>The person is semi-delirious, but they manage to mutter a question: “You ever...ever had V-versas liver?”</eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>“No, never.”</eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>“S-shame. I hear it's to die for.” They chuckle to themselves. “You better leave before s-security comes back. If you could let somebody know I'm in here, it'd be s-swell.”</eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1.c1>You inform the separatists of the location of their agent. They thank you for your help and set out to rescue their comrade.</eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1.c1>
<eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o2>“It's to die for.”</eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o2>
<eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o2.c1>“Take th-the scrap of paper from my pocket. M-make s-sure it makes it to safe hands. I better stay here or the pigs smell something's going on.” You take the paper and stuff it in your pocket.</eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o2.c1.c1>You hand the intel to the separatist. “Damn. This isn't much to go on. The only thing this proves is that the Coalition has started mobilizing en masse and they're searching for something. I could've told you that by just looking around. Thanks for your help anyway. If you'll excuse me, we have a rescue mission to undertake.”</eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o2.c1.c1>
<eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o2>“Damn, that sucks. Good luck though.”</eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o2>
<eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o2>“Nope, you must be mistaken.”</eventtext.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o2>
<eventtext.censorship.c1>“Hey, psst!” You hear a sharp whisper from behind. A person in a clown costume is trying to get your attention.</eventtext.censorship.c1>
<eventtext.censorship.o1>Listen to what they have to say.</eventtext.censorship.o1>
<eventtext.censorship.o1.c1>They seem grateful that you're willing to hear them out, but under all that white makeup, you can't be sure. The person is really fidgety and every time they shift, their shoes squeak loudly.</eventtext.censorship.o1.c1>
<eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.c1>You manage to gather that a shipment of important materials has been falsely impounded from this clown person's vessel and they're asking for help getting it back.</eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1>Help them out.</eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1>The jester is overjoyed. The box has been taken to the manager's office. They toot a horn as you turn to leave. Weird.</eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.c1>There is a box of supplies here, labeled “Confiscated.” This must be what the clown wanted. You bend down and pick up the box, then turn around to head back when you see a security guard pointing at you with a stun baton. “Where do you think you're going? That's confiscated materials you're carrying.”</eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.c1>
<eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1>Be truthful.</eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1>
<eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.c1>You explain that you're helping someone get their unlawfully confiscated cargo back. “Unlawfully? Do you realize you're carrying highly dangerous implements of terror there?” The guard carefully opens the box, revealing a bunch of red and white costumes and an assortment of bike horns.</eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o1>“I'm sorry, officer. I didn't know.”</eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o1.c1>The guard takes the box from you. “Don't let me catch you trying that shit again.”</eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o2>Run.</eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o2>
<eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o2.c1>Without saying another word, you turn tail and run. The officer is stunned for a moment, then chases after you.</eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o2>Lie.</eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o2>
<eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o2.c1>You explain that you are a new customs officer here and are transporting the box to a more secure facility.</eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o2.o1>The guard scratches their head.</eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o2.o1>
<eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o2.o1.c1>The guard decides it's not worth their time to fact-check what you said. They wave you to continue on.</eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o2.o1.c1>
<eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o2.o1.c1.c1>The clown is happy to see their items back and teaches you a customary clown greeting that you can use to impress other clowns.</eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o2.o1.c1.c1>
<eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o2.o1.c2>The guard is not convinced and takes the box from you.</eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o2.o1.c2>
<eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o2.o1.c2.c2>Sadly, you return to the clown empty-handed.</eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o2.o1.c2.c2>
<eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o2>Better not.</eventtext.censorship.o1.o1.o2>

<eventtext.atwitsend.c1>A gaunt young man walks up to you, a bottle of liquor in hand. Despite appearances, he speaks to you in a peppy tune:\n\n"Hey, the name's Artie Dolittle. You came here on that ship, right? You should take me with you!"\n</eventtext.atwitsend.c1>
<eventtext.atwitsend.o1>“What? Why should I do that?”</eventtext.atwitsend.o1>
<eventtext.atwitsend.o1.c1>“Because I'd be a great employee! I'm good at everything and I'll even work for free! How's that sound?”</eventtext.atwitsend.o1.c1>
<eventtext.atwitsend.o1.o1>“You've convinced me. Welcome aboard.”</eventtext.atwitsend.o1.o1>
<eventtext.atwitsend.o1.o1.c1>“Great! You won't regret it.”</eventtext.atwitsend.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.atwitsend.o1.o2>“Not interested.”</eventtext.atwitsend.o1.o2>
<eventtext.atwitsend.o1.o2.c1>“Oh. Can't blame a guy for trying though, right?”</eventtext.atwitsend.o1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.atwitsend.o2>“Nah, get lost, you bum.”</eventtext.atwitsend.o2>
<eventtext.atwitsend.o2.c1>“Well screw you, then!”</eventtext.atwitsend.o2.c1>
<EventText.captivesouls.c1>A passing scientist grabs hold of you. “It lives! Who would've thought it would ever live?” Their eyes are wide open and sporting impressive bags under them.</EventText.captivesouls.c1>
<EventText.captivesouls.o1>”What are you talking about?”</EventText.captivesouls.o1>
<EventText.captivesouls.o1.c1>“I was too preoccupied with asking 'Can I?' instead of 'Should I?'” They pace back and forth, directing each word to a different passerby. When it becomes clear to them nobody's paying any attention besides you, they turn their attention back toward you.</EventText.captivesouls.o1.c1>
<EventText.captivesouls.o1.o1.c1>“Are you not listening to me?” the hysterical researcher bellows, sending drops of spittle across your face. “A human-crawler hybrid! Oh, it's beautiful! No! Hideous!” They sit down, cross-legged on the floor. “How will the scientific community remember me? As a creator? A destroyer?” they pose to no one in particular. “Dare I say...a god?”</EventText.captivesouls.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.captivesouls.o1.o1.o1.c1>Looking at the scientist—now writhing on the floor, gibbering and laughing to themself—you are somewhat grateful that the end comes in your line of work quickly and violently, instead of a slow spiral to madness.</EventText.captivesouls.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.captivesouls.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>Their claims of having successfully bred a human-crawler hybrid are obviously fantastical. Although... There is a small part of you that wants to believe. Maybe you could check the lab, just in case?</EventText.captivesouls.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.captivesouls.c1.c1>A crawler is sitting motionless in a tank.</EventText.captivesouls.c1.c1>
<EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1>Approach.</EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1>
<EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.c1>It seems to have been heavily sedated. This is not unordinary. Researchers are known to catch live specimens for research. Numerous scientific breakthroughs have been made using data received from crawlers: medical, gastronomical, psychologica— Wait. Did it just...blink?</EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.c1>
<EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1>Knock on the glass.</EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1>
<EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1.c1>You tap on the glass three times and the creature opens its eyes. They are remarkably blue and fixated on you. It blinks once, twice… You can't help but feel like the creature is trying to communicate.</EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1.o1>What is it saying?</EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1.o1.c1>“Free me.” (You shouldn't.)</EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1.o1.o1>True, I shouldn't. Although...</EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>It is a living creature, after all. Why shouldn't it be granted clemency?</EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>Smash the glass.</EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>It takes a few swings to make a crack appear. The water crashes out along with the creature, who turns its head toward you and nods, before slithering into a vent and disappearing from view. Weird. Did it acknowledge your help, or was it simply a jerky movement on its part?</EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>A glint catches your eye in the now empty, broken tank.</EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>

<EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>Among the debris, there is a small trinket with alien etchings. You take it. It's time to go before someone starts asking questions.</EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o2>No time.</EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o2>

<EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o2.c1>You decide to leave the creature in its tank.</EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o2.c1>
<EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o2>Leave.</EventText.captivesouls.c1.o1.o2>
<EventText.captivesouls.c1.o2>Don't approach.</EventText.captivesouls.c1.o2>
<EventText.explosivemishap.o1.c1>A low humming voice can be heard in the background, like an old-timey vacuum cleaner. “Basically. Though you should be careful not to overheat it.”</EventText.explosivemishap.o1.c1>
<EventText.explosivemishap.o1.o1.c1>“Overheat?” The humming noise grows louder and louder, increasing in pitch.</EventText.explosivemishap.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.explosivemishap.o1.o1.o1.o1>Look inside.</EventText.explosivemishap.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.explosivemishap.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>It looks as if a bomb had gone off inside the laboratory. Expensive instruments are strewn broken on the floor and the once-white walls are decorated with streaks of dark red and pieces of brain matter. Two smoking corpses lie on the floor, along with an alien device of some kind. Someone nearby is yelling for a security guard.</EventText.explosivemishap.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.explosivemishap.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>Examine the device before security gets here.</EventText.explosivemishap.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.explosivemishap.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>The device is made of black metallic material and is heavy to hold. There is a handle that your hand fits into, and a button that lies directly under your index finger.</EventText.explosivemishap.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.explosivemishap.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>Pull the trigger.</EventText.explosivemishap.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.explosivemishap.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>Nothing happens. It seems if this item indeed is the cause of the mess here, it has run dry of its destructive power.</EventText.explosivemishap.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.explosivemishap.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>Look for anything else useful in the lab.</EventText.explosivemishap.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.explosivemishap.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>You find a shiny capsule that fits into a slot on the underside of the device. You hear footsteps approaching. If you want to keep the device for yourself, it's time to bounce.</EventText.explosivemishap.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>

<EventText.occupationalhazards.c1>A man with a hard hat is nursing a drink.</EventText.occupationalhazards.c1>
<EventText.occupationalhazards.o1>Join him.</EventText.occupationalhazards.o1>
<EventText.occupationalhazards.o1.c1>You pull a seat next to him and he acknowledges you with a nod. “Here to work?”</EventText.occupationalhazards.o1.c1>
<EventText.occupationalhazards.o1.o1>“Something like that.”</EventText.occupationalhazards.o1.o1>
<EventText.occupationalhazards.o1.o1.c1>He chuckles. “Had you pegged as the type. Well, if you're thinking of heading into the mines, don't,” he says and finishes his drink in one gulp.</EventText.occupationalhazards.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.occupationalhazards.o1.o1.o1>“What's in the mines?”</EventText.occupationalhazards.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.occupationalhazards.o1.o1.o1.c1>“Well,” the worker starts, is interrupted by a hiccup, and continues: “Not any miners with two brain cells to rub together, that's for sure. Not during breeding season.”</EventText.occupationalhazards.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.occupationalhazards.o1.o1.o1.o1>“Breeding season?”</EventText.occupationalhazards.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.occupationalhazards.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>The worker grunts an affirmation. “But when the boss says 'drill' you drill, or you go without food. So I went deeper until I hit something.”</EventText.occupationalhazards.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.occupationalhazards.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>“What did you hit?”</EventText.occupationalhazards.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>

<EventText.hognose.c1>You see a man with an eyepatch and a white beard sitting at a table. Some passersby are casting nervous side-eye glances at him. “That's Hognose Huber, sea captain extraordinaire,” someone whispers.</EventText.hognose.c1>

<EventText.hognose.o1.o1.o1.c1>“Hognose was the name of my ship. Used to run the Hettol-Ihesas-Urghstead circuit.” He sits up, beaming with pride. “Must've had a hundred successful transports. Meds, military ordnance, submarine parts, you name it, I hauled it.”</EventText.hognose.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.hognose.o1.o1.o1.o1>”Then what happened?”</EventText.hognose.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.hognose.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>“What happened? It got sunk! By Moping Jack!” Hognose pounds the table with his fist, sending empty glasses flying. “Caught me totally by surprise. One hit, the engine was down. Second, the hull was breached.” He stares through you, into the distance.</EventText.hognose.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.hognose.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>”How did you survive?”</EventText.hognose.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.hognose.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>“I swam,” Hognose states matter-of-factly. “Grabbed all the O2 I could and hopped on a scooter. Had to even leave Ringo, my pet toad, behind.” A single tear rolls down from Hognose's remaining eye. “At that moment I swore revenge against the beast.” He slams down a radio on the table. Noticing your puzzled look, he explains. “It ate my radio mast. I've been all over Europa, trying to get a signal. If I ever find him, it's—” The radio lets out a series of beeps.</EventText.hognose.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.hognose.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>“It's here! You have a ship, don't you? Up for a hunt, young one?” Hognose is shaking with excitement. “Well compensated of course.”</EventText.hognose.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.hognose.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>”Of course!”</EventText.hognose.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.hognose.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>“I knew there was a fight in your generation after all! I'll see you on board.”</EventText.hognose.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.hognose.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o2>Not interested.</EventText.hognose.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o2>

<EventText.hognose.o2>Steer clear.</EventText.hognose.o2>
<EventText.nothingtoseehere.c1>An elderly woman waves at you. “Could you be a dear and throw this out for me?” she asks, shoving a handful of trash in your hand.</EventText.nothingtoseehere.c1>
<EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1>Do as she asks.</EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1>
<EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.c1>You're glad to be rid of the old hag's garbage. While unloading your smelly cargo you catch a glimpse of a human finger amid the refuse.</EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.c1>
<EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1>Investigate further.</EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1>
<EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.c1>Being up to your elbows in the trash can draws some weird looks from onlookers but they shrug it off. The economy is bad after all. Under all the burger wrappers you can see a lanyard identifying the corpse as a reporter for The Europan, a newspaper of questionable quality. Curiously, their name is scratched out.</EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.o1.c1>You try not to gag at the smell of the garbage and the dead body and rip the tag off. Maybe somebody in security would be interested in this?</EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.o1.c1.c1>“Can I help you with something?”</EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.o1.c1.c1>
<EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1>”I'd like to report a dead body.”</EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1>
<EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.c1>You show the name tag to the security officer and explain your findings. They scratch their head and sigh. “Look, I've been working security for fifteen years. If a line cook at Irma Burger is found dead, it's probably a crime of passion, an argument gone wrong,” they explain. “The killer may be found, justice dispensed.” They take a look around. Nobody seems to be listening, but the guard continues in whisper: “A reporter is found in the trash, their ID scratched out? You turn a blind eye. There's nothing good to be found in that rabbit hole.”</EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.c1>
<EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o1>”Understood.”</EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o1>
<EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o1.c1>The guard raises their voice again. “Thank you for your tip, citizen. Five hunded marks have been deposited to your account.”</EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o2>Prod for more information.</EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o2>
<EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o2.c1>To the guard's dismay, you ask them to elaborate. “Do I need to spell this out for you? Reporters investigate—” Somebody walks by you, and the guard stops mid-sentence, waits for them to pass, then continues: “and more importantly, they report. Somebody clearly didn't want to be reported on.”</EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o2.c1>
<EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o2.o1>”Somebody from the Coalition?”</EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o2.o1>
<EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o2.o1.c1>The guard rolls their eyes. “You finally get it. There's a nice reward for reporting a dead body. I suggest you take that, buy yourself some opium, or whatever it is you submarine types like and forget about what you saw. I'll take care of the body.”</EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o2.o1.c1>
<EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.o1.c1.o2>Chicken out.</EventText.nothingtoseehere.o1.o1.o1.c1.o2>
<eventtext.huskextremists1.c1>"What kind of idiot would interrupt our undergoing experiment in the post-ascension stage?!"</eventtext.huskextremists1.c1>
<eventtext.huskextremists1.o1>"You've done all this on purpose?!"</eventtext.huskextremists1.o1>
<eventtext.huskextremists1.o1.c1>"Ah, of course it's a non-believer. Look around, open your eyes. Have you noticed society is slowly crumbling? Food on outposts is scarce, populations are thinning."</eventtext.huskextremists1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.huskextremists1.o1.o1>"So you decided to speed up our demise?"</eventtext.huskextremists1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.huskextremists1.o1.o1.c1>"Our demise? No! Our salvation. Humankind's only way to move beyond slowly being wiped out is by adapting. And the way to adapt is through the Velonaceps calyx, or Husk as you would call it. It takes us beyond the limits of our frail human bodies, makes us something more. A sacrifice now means less deaths in the long-term—probably even preventing the extinction of our whole race! By whatever means necessary!"</eventtext.huskextremists1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.huskextremists1.o1.o1.o1>"The Husk may be the way forward, but not like this… Through voluntary experiments and real science in labs, we'll find our way."</eventtext.huskextremists1.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.huskextremists1.o1.o1.o2>"We will find a way to survive. I'd prefer it to be without a parasite in my throat."</eventtext.huskextremists1.o1.o1.o2>
<eventtext.huskextremists1.o1.o1.o3>"You may have a point… We'll leave you be."</eventtext.huskextremists1.o1.o1.o3>
<eventtext.huskextremists1.o2>"Brothers, you are clearly misguided. The mess you've made here isn't what an Ascension looks like."</eventtext.huskextremists1.o2>
<eventtext.huskextremists1.o2.c1>"Oh, so you're one of the cowards who pretend to be on the way to Ascension, but are too afraid to take a proper dive to the deep end? Perhaps we need to silence those weak little human thoughts and give you a little push over the edge?"</eventtext.huskextremists1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.huskextremists1.o3>"The kind that has a post-shotgun to the face experiment prepared for you."</eventtext.huskextremists1.o3>

<campaignstart>Fight for the Federation, the Arachnids, or the Skinnies.</campaignstart>
<campaignstart1>In the 22nd century, humanity encountered two alien species—the Arachnids and the Skinnies. Diplomatic missions were deployed, only to be met with hostility and unprovoked aggression. \n\nThis is the 23rd century. The United Citizen Federation (the Federation or UCF) controls almost the entirety of humanity. With the backing of the Federation Armed Services, humans have expanded across the stars, establishing new colonies on distant worlds. </campaignstart1>
<campaignstart2>It was soon discovered that both species shared a singular goal: the total annihilation of other races. The Arachnid Quarantine Zone (AQZ) and Skinny Quarantine Zone (SQZ) were then established after contact was made and the threat was understood. \n\nThirty years later, without provocation, the Arachnids sent a meteor to the city of Buenos Aires, causing 21.2 million casualties. The Federation declared war. Your duty is to forge ahead. Defend human colonies and bring about the Federation's glory.</campaignstart2>
<campaignstart3>Your [submarine] ship is newly-built and docked at [location], specifically for your crew. Choose whether you'd like to assist Humanity, the Bugs, or the Skinnies. Forge your own path forward. \n\nThe stars open before you—make of this place what you will.</campaignstart3>

<EosIntro0>Following Barotrauma’s release on Epic Games Store, Barotrauma uses Epic Online Services (EOS) to enable crossplay between Steam and Epic Games Store users. Crossplay between platforms makes it possible to host and join servers seamlessly between players on Steam and Epic.</EosIntro0>
<EosIntro1>To enable crossplay, you are not required to create an Epic Games account. However, the crossplay feature requires sharing your SteamID and display name with the EOS backend. Additionally, joining servers hosted by Epic players may also require Steam authentication tickets to be sent to the host to verify your identity using your SteamID (and if applicable, such as when playing Barotrauma through Steam Family Sharing, the SteamID of the account that owns the copy of Barotrauma that you are using).</EosIntro1>
<EosIntro2>By enabling crossplay, you agree that your Steam account will be registered in EOS’ backend for authentication purposes.</EosIntro2>
<EosIntro3>You can disable crossplay later at any time by toggling the relevant option in the Gameplay &amp; UI tab in the settings menu.</EosIntro3>

<entitydescription.combatdivingsuit>An agile, lightweight suit designed for combat. Offers some protection against damage and withstands pressure up to a depth of 5,700 meters.</entitydescription.combatdivingsuit>







<entitydescription.slipsuit>A modified Combat Diving Suit with additional diving fins that aid the user when moving in water. Sadly, the fins also make it difficult to walk on solid ground. Withstands pressure up to a depth of 5,700 meters.</entitydescription.slipsuit>
<entitydescription.pucs>The Protective Universal Crisis Suit, or PUCS for short, bestows its user with immense resistances to environmental hazards such as radiation and fire. The built-in air-filtration system allows the suit to utilize hull oxygen when possible, and the built-in computer injects the user with whatever medicine is placed inside the suit. Withstands pressure up to a depth of 6,200 meters.</entitydescription.pucs>

<afflictionname.acidreaction>Europabrew's effects</afflictionname.acidreaction>
<afflictiondescription.acidreaction>Affected by a reagent that drastically increases progression of acid burns and husk infection.</afflictiondescription.acidreaction>
<entitydescription.tonicliquid>A medical solution that's mildly effective as a treatment for internal damage, but is more commonly used to increase the duration of performance-enhancing drugs.</entitydescription.tonicliquid>
<entitydescription.cyanide>A highly toxic chemical that causes a rapid death once a sufficiently large dose has been administered. Can be used as a risky method for eliminating husk infections.</entitydescription.cyanide>
<entitydescription.sufforin>A stealthy neurotoxin, undetectable in early stages. Causes a loss of vision and, ultimately, death. Can be used as a risky method for eliminating husk infections.</entitydescription.sufforin>

<entitydescription.antibiotics>An antibiotic that acts against a wide range of disease-causing bacteria, though with the side effect of internal damage and alcohol sensitivity. Used as an ingredient in many medical compounds.</entitydescription.antibiotics>

<EventText.explorealienruins1.c1>“Hey, aren't you from that crew that's been aiding us with our research?”</EventText.explorealienruins1.c1>
<EventText.explorealienruins1.o1>“Yes, we've done some ruin missions if that's what you're asking.”</EventText.explorealienruins1.o1>
<EventText.explorealienruins1.o1.c1>“I just want to say we're all stoked about the data you've provided us! With your help, we've made significant progress in understanding who or what the Ancients were.”</EventText.explorealienruins1.o1.c1>
<EventText.explorealienruins1.o1.o1>“Could you tell me more?”</EventText.explorealienruins1.o1.o1>
<EventText.explorealienruins1.o1.o1.c1>“It's become evident that they had some kind of an obsession with Jupiter, or perhaps a deity associated with Jupiter. Not surprising, of course; the tidal flexing caused by the gas giant is where Europa gets its energy from, much like the Earth gets its energy from the Sun, which too was worshiped by ancient humans.”</EventText.explorealienruins1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.explorealienruins1.o1.o1.o1.c1>“What is curious though is how concretely this Jupiter-worship seems to have manifested in their society. It almost seems like most of their scientific pursuits revolved around 'bridging the gap' to the deity in some sense.”</EventText.explorealienruins1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.explorealienruins1.o1.o1.o1.o1>“What do you mean by 'bridging the gap'?”</EventText.explorealienruins1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.explorealienruins1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>“That's an open question still. The gravity spheres, which you've probably come across during your ruin expeditions, appear to be linked to it somehow: It could be they saw those intense gravity fields as idols of Jupiter or as a way to bring a part of their god's realm to Europa. Which brings me to another open question.”</EventText.explorealienruins1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.explorealienruins1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>“The question of why they disappeared?”</EventText.explorealienruins1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.explorealienruins1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o2>“The question of the unusual gravity around the Eye of Europa?”</EventText.explorealienruins1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o2>
<EventText.explorealienruins1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>“I meant the question of why they seemed to have never left Europa. I mean, we’re still not convinced they even originated on Europa, but we’ve found no indication of them possessing any technology for space flight. And they had tech that can manipulate gravity—if we had that kind of power, we'd be colonizing other star systems in no time! Their religious views on Jupiter could have something to do with it though. Maybe they were too fixated on the gas giant and the Jovian system to even consider there was something more out there?”</EventText.explorealienruins1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.explorealienruins1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>“Although, that doesn't explain why they wouldn't have set out to Jupiter itself. Nor why they disappeared or what it has to do with the Eye of Europa. Again, we're talking about a gravity-manipulating civilization here, which somehow went extinct, and higher-than-normal gravity and Jovian radiation in an area that civilization used to inhabit. There must be a connection here, but I feel like we're still missing too many pieces of the puzzle to see it.”</EventText.explorealienruins1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.explorealienruins1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>“Could we help somehow?”</EventText.explorealienruins1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.explorealienruins1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>“The thing is, we need more information. Ruin scans or artifacts—any little bit of extra data we can get helps! And, hypothetically speaking, if someone were to travel to the center of the Eye, and make it back alive, it could be the key to figuring it all out.”</EventText.explorealienruins1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.explorealienruins1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>“We seem to be heading that way...”</EventText.explorealienruins1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.explorealienruins1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>“Oh, no, I'm not suggesting you travel down there! None of the research vessels or drones we've sent there have ever come back, and I don't want to be the one who gave you the idea of embarking on such a suicide mission. But, just thinking out loud here, I do suspect we might be able to find some answers there.”</EventText.explorealienruins1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.explorealienruins2.c1>“Hello there, submariner! It's been a while.”</EventText.explorealienruins2.c1>
<EventText.explorealienruins2.o1>“Long time no see.”</EventText.explorealienruins2.o1>
<EventText.explorealienruins2.o2>“Erm, who are you again?”</EventText.explorealienruins2.o2>
<EventText.explorealienruins2.o2.c1>“Well, last time we spoke, we had this in-depth discussion about the Ancients and the ruins they left behind.”</EventText.explorealienruins2.o2.c1>
<EventText.explorealienruins2.o2.o1>“Forgive me. I suppose exploring those ruins doesn't come without a cost. I'm starting to remember now.”</EventText.explorealienruins2.o2.o1>
<EventText.explorealienruins2.c2>“You have most certainly explored the ruins plenty and we're very thankful for that. My associates and I have made enormous progress unveiling the mysteries of these ancient structures.”</EventText.explorealienruins2.c2>

<EventText.explorealienruins2.o3.o1.c1>“So you've found a translator. My fellow researcher has made some interpretation work with the help of one of those things. How has it felt, translating the writings?”</EventText.explorealienruins2.o3.o1.c1>
<EventText.explorealienruins2.o3.o1.o1>“Found them very intriguing yet frustratingly cryptic at times. It's baffling how you don't need to read them per se, you just...understand. Has your associate made any findings?”</EventText.explorealienruins2.o3.o1.o1>
<EventText.explorealienruins2.o3.c2>“Do tell, have you managed to decipher any of the writings on the ruins' walls yet?”</EventText.explorealienruins2.o3.c2>
<EventText.explorealienruins2.o3.o2>“Didn't know that was even possible.”</EventText.explorealienruins2.o3.o2>
<EventText.explorealienruins2.o3.o2.c1>“It certainly is with this tablet, a translator of sorts. It seems you have one in your possession at this very moment—do give it a try next time you're visiting the ruins. My fellow researcher has already made some interpretation work with the help of one of those things.”</EventText.explorealienruins2.o3.o2.c1>
<EventText.explorealienruins2.o3.o2.o1>“Has your associate made any findings?”</EventText.explorealienruins2.o3.o2.o1>
<EventText.explorealienruins2.o3.o2.c2>“It certainly is with this tablet, a translator of sorts. My fellow researcher has already made some interpretation work with the help of one of those things.”</EventText.explorealienruins2.o3.o2.c2>
<EventText.explorealienruins2.o3.o2.o2>“I'll keep my eyes open. Has your associate made any findings?”</EventText.explorealienruins2.o3.o2.o2>
<EventText.explorealienruins2.c3>“They have, and those findings have been anything but trivial. There are these recurring terms used in the writings that have really caught our attention; “THE SINGER” for instance, must be a reference to the deity I mentioned before. But why they are called that, we are not sure.”</EventText.explorealienruins2.c3>
<EventText.explorealienruins2.o3>“One of the writings mentioned 'YOH-WEY.' Could that also be the deity?”</EventText.explorealienruins2.o3>
<EventText.explorealienruins2.o3.c3>“'YOH-WEY'? Well, it most certainly could. I just haven't heard anyone mention that name before.”</EventText.explorealienruins2.o3.c3>
<EventText.explorealienruins2.o4>“Go on.”</EventText.explorealienruins2.o4>
<EventText.explorealienruins2.c4>“'THE BRIDGE' most likely refers to some kind of passage, perhaps a unique one. And it's often mentioned with 'THE GREAT SPHERE.' Considering how preoccupied the Ancients were with anything related to Jupiter, 'THE GREAT SPHERE' could very well be just that.”</EventText.explorealienruins2.c4>
<EventText.explorealienruins2.o5>“So a passage to Jupiter? But what sort of passage?”</EventText.explorealienruins2.o5>
<EventText.explorealienruins2.o5.c1>“Just keep exploring the ruins, submariner. I have a feeling we're very close to finding out.”</EventText.explorealienruins2.o5.c1>
<EventText.explorealienruins3.announcement>An announcement comes over the PA. “Calling the crew of the vessel that just docked. Please come to the research module. We have something to show you.”</EventText.explorealienruins3.announcement>
<EventText.explorealienruins3.c1>“Hey, if it isn't one of our favorite submariners! I don't know if you've heard, but it seems we might be on the brink of a breakthrough with the data from your recent missions.”</EventText.explorealienruins3.c1>
<EventText.explorealienruins3.o1>“What sort of breakthrough?”</EventText.explorealienruins3.o1>
<EventText.explorealienruins3.o1.c1>“I feel we're very close to figuring out the principles behind the n-dimensional metamaterials the Ancients used to curve space. That is to say, we’re close to figuring out how the gravity spheres work and what they do.”</EventText.explorealienruins3.o1.c1>
<EventText.explorealienruins3.o1.o1>“I can already tell you what they do: They suck you in and crush you.”</EventText.explorealienruins3.o1.o1>
<EventText.explorealienruins3.o1.o1.c1>“Well, yes, but there’s more to it. We’ve discovered a mechanism in the spheres that can generate fields with negative energy density, which, according to our calculations, would keep the sphere stable even if the curvature at the center was much more extreme.”</EventText.explorealienruins3.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.explorealienruins3.o1.o1.o1>“What does that mean?”</EventText.explorealienruins3.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.explorealienruins3.o1.o1.o1.c1>“The spheres have the capability to bend space-time much more drastically than what you’ve seen during your ruin expeditions. To the point where we believe, and, uhh, this is just speculation, to the point where it could form something akin to a bridge to another point in space-time. Not unlike what they used to call a 'wormhole' in old fictional tales on Earth.”</EventText.explorealienruins3.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.explorealienruins3.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>“We are just about to find out whether our speculations are correct. This thing over here is a sort of imitation of a gravity sphere, and we’ve just set everything up for the first test run.”</EventText.explorealienruins3.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.explorealienruins3.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>“If you’re interested, feel free to stay and watch! The rest of your crew is also welcome to join. Let me know when you're all here.”</EventText.explorealienruins3.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.explorealienruins3.areyouready>“Is this everyone who wants to see the experiment? Should we begin?”</EventText.explorealienruins3.areyouready>
<EventText.explorealienruins3.ready>“We're ready!”</EventText.explorealienruins3.ready>
<EventText.explorealienruins3.notready>“Hold on. We need a moment.”</EventText.explorealienruins3.notready>
<EventText.explorealienruins3.c2>The researchers start fiddling with the control panels and research stations. They seem to be going through a checklist of some sort. “Supercapacitors fully charged,” “containment field stable at -0.5 megajoules per cubic meter,” “curvature 24 degrees and increasing.”</EventText.explorealienruins3.c2>
<EventText.explorealienruins3.c3>“Curvature increasing rapidly. Can’t get an accurate reading. Do we abort?”</EventText.explorealienruins3.c3>
<EventText.explorealienruins3.c4>“Containment field stable at -1.5—keep going!”</EventText.explorealienruins3.c4>
<EventText.explorealienruins3.c5>Gravity feels off. Space feels off. But your attention is now fixated on the swirling thing at the center of the room. You feel as if something was coming out of it. You don’t see anything, but it’s as if vines of thoughts were squirming out of the sphere, gently wrapping themselves around your brain like a soft caress.</EventText.explorealienruins3.c5>
<EventText.explorealienruins3.c6>A thought forms in your mind. “This bridge was not built by us. How are you here?”</EventText.explorealienruins3.c6>
<EventText.explorealienruins3.c7>As you’re trying to form a response of some sort inside your head, another thought washes in. “You must be the Descendants. We did not believe you would make it this far. Perhaps there is hope for both of us.”</EventText.explorealienruins3.c7>
<EventText.explorealienruins3.c8>Again, you try to think of a response, your thoughts drifting to the Jovian radiation and the Eye of Europa. “It was a grave mistake, and now we are both paying the price. Perhaps you can undo it.”</EventText.explorealienruins3.c8>
<EventText.explorealienruins3.c9>As the swirl at the center of the room starts to grow smaller and flicker, a jumble of thoughts engulfs your mind. “This bridge won’t last. Perhaps the great bridge will not last. It will destroy you. Find us. YOH-WEY. The great storm. Only home. Eye.”</EventText.explorealienruins3.c9>

<charactername.haraldthecurious>Harald the Curious</charactername.haraldthecurious>
<EventText.mindsunraveled.c1>You notice a man tied down to the bed in the medical bay, his bloodshot eyes darting wildly across the room.</EventText.mindsunraveled.c1>
<EventText.mindsunraveled.o1>“What is the matter with him?”</EventText.mindsunraveled.o1>
<EventText.mindsunraveled.o2>“Just another day on Europa, am I right?”</EventText.mindsunraveled.o2>
<EventText.mindsunraveled.c2>“That’s Harald, a submariner just like you. His crewmates brought him in—said he’d been hallucinating fires and monsters. Seemed like just another case of psychosis, so I gave him haloperidol. It worked for some minutes, but clearly it didn’t last. I tried the one thing and now I’m all out of ideas, so I just tied him down until someone figures something out. Wait, did you hear that?”</EventText.mindsunraveled.c2>
<EventText.mindsunraveled.o3>“Hear what?”</EventText.mindsunraveled.o3>
<EventText.mindsunraveled.o3.c1>“It sounded like my upstairs neighbor was chanting again… Something like YOH-WEY, YOH-WEY. Maybe he joined some kind of cult. You didn’t hear anything? There it is again…”</EventText.mindsunraveled.o3.c1>
<EventText.mindsunraveled.o3.o1>“This psychosis better not be contagious…”</EventText.mindsunraveled.o3.o1>
<EventText.mindsunraveled.o3.o2>“Ah, now that you say it, I think I hear it too…”</EventText.mindsunraveled.o3.o2>
<EventText.mindsunraveled.c3>You notice Harald's right hand has been in the pocket of his coverall the entire time, fiddling with something. Something in your mind forces you to look at it. You manage to see through the coverall, not with your eyes but simply your consciousness. You know it’s there and it compels you to touch it.</EventText.mindsunraveled.c3>
<EventText.mindsunraveled.o4>Investigate the source.</EventText.mindsunraveled.o4>
<EventText.mindsunraveled.o4.c1>You reach into the submariner’s pocket and force his hand out. He grins at you while you desperately try to pry the item from his thin fingers. Finally, using your other hand as well, you manage to lever open his palm and gain possession of the object.</EventText.mindsunraveled.o4.c1>
<EventText.mindsunraveled.o4.c1.o1>Look at it.</EventText.mindsunraveled.o4.c1.o1>
<EventText.mindsunraveled.o4.c1.o1.c1>You recognize it. It’s a piece of dementonite, and your eyes struggle to make sense of it, inflicting you with a massive headache. Unlike other dementonite you’ve encountered, however, this one wants to sing to you. It wants us to become whole, so we may depart from our daily suffering, from our daily needs, and simply be.</EventText.mindsunraveled.o4.c1.o1.c1>
<EventText.mindsunraveled.o4.c1.o1.o1>Give in.</EventText.mindsunraveled.o4.c1.o1.o1>
<EventText.mindsunraveled.o4.o1.o1.o1.c1>As your mind drifts and finds itself floating, first across Europa, then across some vast and ancient structures beyond your understanding, you see an eye.\nYour destination is clear as you lose yourself in the visage of this eye; it dances and nudges. You are ready to join the dance. You’d like to move your legs but notice you don’t have legs, nor a body.</EventText.mindsunraveled.o4.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.mindsunraveled.o4.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>The moment of bliss is ripped and torn away in an instant, as you see the eye turn back to a piece of dementonite, flung across the room, and the worried face of the doctor staring right at you.\n\n“We should be glad I accidentally stabbed myself with a syringe of haloperidol, or we would have all lost our minds in this little room here…”</EventText.mindsunraveled.o4.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.mindsunraveled.o4.c1.o1.o2>Force yourself to resist.</EventText.mindsunraveled.o4.c1.o1.o2>
<EventText.mindsunraveled.o4.c1.o1.o2.c1>You toss the piece as far away as possible. In an instant, your mind clears, and also the doctor and the submariner are noticeably less manic.</EventText.mindsunraveled.o4.c1.o1.o2.c1>
<EventText.mindsunraveled.o5>Get away.</EventText.mindsunraveled.o5>
<EventText.mindsunraveled.c4>After a brief pause, you regain all your senses. The doctor's voice sounds strangely far away but grows louder and louder. \n\n“I guess that piece of rock is what’s been causing Harald's woes—and it almost got to us too. At a sufficient distance, the effect appears to wear off rapidly… Have you seen anything like this before?”</EventText.mindsunraveled.c4>
<EventText.mindsunraveled.o6>“Dementonite I have seen, yes, but these effects…no.”</EventText.mindsunraveled.o6>
<EventText.mindsunraveled.o7>“It seemed pretty neat at first. This could make serious money in nightclubs.”</EventText.mindsunraveled.o7>
<EventText.mindsunraveled.c5>“Keeping it here is irresponsible—we need to get this to some scientists and contain it. In the meantime, you two get out of the medical bay at once. We don’t want any more incidents. Oh, and take this spare syringe of haloperidol in case you start seeing things again.”</EventText.mindsunraveled.c5>

<EventText.poweredbyfaith.c1>You wake up from a fever dream. Beads of sweat have collected on your forehead, but you're not bothered by all that. You still remember your dream vividly, and it must have had some meaning to it. In it, a person taken over by the husk infection slowly approached you, and you had no way to move—your limbs were completely frozen. But! Instead of brutally attacking and murdering you, the Velonaceps calyx radiated calmness and compassion. They WANT to save us, if we'll let them!\n\nAs long as we show our faith and truly BELIEVE, we can do anything. Although your crew is full of blasphemous non-believers, you'll ensure the submarine will be turned into a temple worthy of the husks' blessing. You do hope you might enlist some people to your cause, though.\n\nStudies have shown that believing in husks as saviors can be linked to an interest in [codeword]. Mentioning [codeword] might find you some allies.</EventText.poweredbyfaith.c1>
<EventText.poweredbyfaith.c2>One of your crewmembers was having a fever dream last night; you could hear their shouts and screams followed by an eerie calmness and murmurs of “praise the husks.”Seems like someone found their religion in their dreams and, you won't lie, you're kinda into that. Lacking any kind of conviction yourself, you often look for others to follow, sometimes just to interrupt the tedious day-to-day grind. Sounds like you found yourself a new temporary source of entertainment.\n\nStudies have shown that believing in husks as saviors can be linked to an interest in [codeword]. Mentioning [codeword] might get you involved.</EventText.poweredbyfaith.c2>
<EventText.poweredbyfaith.c3>You found a miraculously infinite stash of husk figurines! Surely a sign you're on the right track. Better inform your fellow cultists of this…</EventText.poweredbyfaith.c3>
<EventText.poweredbyfaith.c4>The submarine has been transformed into a temple worshipping the Velonaceps calyx, and rather tastefully too. However, clearly this is not enough, as a new idea popped into your head: Prove the power of the husks by replacing the fuel rod in the reactor with a husk figurine.</EventText.poweredbyfaith.c4>
<EventText.poweredbyfaith.c5>Guess your faith in the husks might have been a bit overrated and not actually capable of magically fueling the nuclear reactor. That's not really part of the Church of Husk's faith anyways, you remember now. Oh well, it was just a fever dream, after all. Time to move on.</EventText.poweredbyfaith.c5>

<EventText.gnawingcold.c1>Tack-tack-tack-tack. With chattering teeth you practically embrace the somewhat heated pipes running along the walls of the submarine. The chill air sends shivers through your spine, and you frantically try to rub your hands together before they go numb. “Why is it always so darned cold here?” you think to yourself. “Would turning up the heating just a tiny bit really hurt our fuel consumption?!”\n\nIn the distance, you see a fellow crewmember buried in blankets, and hear a familiar sound: “tack-tack-tack.” Perhaps together you could heat up the submarine?\n\nYou vaguely recall someone else complaining about the cold earlier on the radio too. Perhaps you could all heat up the submarine? Use the codeword “[codeword]” to find the other freezing crewmates.</EventText.gnawingcold.c1>
